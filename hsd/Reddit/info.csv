kdwizk,gaming,Hard to find good games sometimes.,Ever notice just how many bad games there are? Not to say there aren't a lot of good games it just takes a bit of searching.   I was researching the gamecube game library & so many of them are movie games.   Kids movie games are almost always trash.   Who on Earth thought having that many of them was a good idea?   It's the same thing with the wii.  Anyway i looked at the gamecube thing & a shit ton of them were mivie games so that's that.   There were like 40 or so good games a lot of them were racing games.     Looked at the 360 library it was marginally better.Noticed the movie game seemed to be mainly a nintendo thing i think.  More original games but the quality still felt iffy.  That's about it i haven't really cheked out many other console libraries yet but from what i saw it seems there's a lot of junk out there.   But eh that was just 3 consoles perhaps the others have better.  was it just a thing to do with that era of the gaming industry?

There are two types of flair on this subreddit:

The first is **user flair**. You can change your user flair in the sidebar through editing. It is recommended that you change it to your in-game name and friend code so people can track you and trade with you. The country of origin field is optional, but it makes it more convenient for people who want to trade with you if you put it in. 

The second is **link flair**. The link flair is designed so that if you put any  Pokémon's name in the title, a picture of that Pokémon will show in the thumbnail. This works with every language. It doesn't matter if you put in Bulbasaur or Bisasam. However, if you only put in the name Nidoran, though, it will show up as a Nidoran♀, even if you meant Nidoran♂."

kdx10h,gaming,Games I’ve Played this Year & Their Ratings,"Games I’ve Played This Year & Their Ratings

Hey guys - I’m making this list for a few reasons. One is I want to take a trip down memory lane during this insane year for all of us in 2020. Two, I’ve never really tried ranking games before and I’ve always wanted to. Three, I like to get feedback and see what types of games other people like.

P.S. - I am going to say whether I got platinum in the game or not. This is not to brag, because I know lots of people dislike trophies, it’s to show that I put serious time into these games and have the valid ability to rate them. Hope you enjoy! 


1.) Detroit: Become Human - 9.3/10

This game is actually the very first “movie-type” game I’ve ever played. I was blown away by the storytelling, the characters, and just how emotional it was. The characters all feel real & the way your choices impact the story is intense and direct. I can’t really say anything negative about the game, and so many scenes I ended up recording and sometimes I still go back and watch them because of how cool they are (like rappelling up the news station). I did get the platinum. 

2.) Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order - 8.1/10

I really did enjoy the game, but it was missing a certain charm for me that would have brought it to the next level. I didn’t really like the way they did their maps & exploration, & I found the game to be way too easy. I also felt like the game was short. I really did enjoy the beautiful planets you get to go to and I thought the combat did make you feel like a Jedi. My least favorite aspect of the game was the scarcity of bosses. I can only remember like 1 or 2 that stick out in my mind. For a Souls-like, this was a disappointment. I did get the platinum.

3.) Resident Evil 7: Biohazard - 8.7/10

Solid ass game. I’ve only ever played Resident Evil 5, and this one. So I know I need to play Resident Evil 2 & 3 Remakes next. I found this game to be pretty damn terrifying because the game truly makes you feel like you’re stuck on the compound and the Baker family can and will pop out to murder you at any second. This is because of a masterful job by the producers on making the environment scary AF and having good pacing. I also enjoyed the plot twists and the story in general. The gameplay was average but overall, I really like this game. The boss fights stand out to me which I never expected for a game like this. I rarely if ever played this game when home alone or at night because I’m a baby. I did get the platinum. 

4.) Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons - 9.3/10

Well, this game made me cry. It’s extremely short, but I’ve never played a game that made you use the controls quite like this one. You control each brother using separate sides of the controller which sounds tricky at first, but after like 30 minutes it’s second nature. The environments are gorgeous, the story is emotional and beautiful, and the pace is perfection. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. I got all the trophies but there is no platinum. 

5.) Metro Exodus - 5.6/10

Ugh...I definitely did not like this game. The Russian accents were pretty sweet, but the writing was plain corny, and the game was overall buggy to be fair. I really thought I would enjoy this game but I found the combat to be  average & one-dimensional, the characters never made me feel like I wanted to get invested in them, and the environments were bland at best. I got the platinum which was an absolute slog because a few trophies require you to save characters in each chapter, and this is based on certain choices and actions. It took me multiple tries for each one because the game didn’t really adhere to its own trophy requirement. Hard to explain but basically it was a horrible buggy chore. I wish I could like this game, but I strongly do not. 

6.) What Remains of Edith Finch - 9/10

This game is sort of half puzzle and half movie based. You basically go through each member of the family and find out what happened to them, and man, some of the stories are beautiful & some are tragic. This one made both my friend and I cry because some are just so intense. It’s VERY short (3-4 hours), but 100% worth playing. I would say a lot more about it, but it would be hard to without spoiling it. Each family member’s story is unique and the story/puzzle you complete ties into beautifully to that person. Also the environments & the house you explore are quite beautiful too. I got all the trophies, but there is no platinum.

7.) Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition - 9.6/10

This game is a masterpiece to me. It’s my first ever top down western RPG, and I was blown away. The combat is smart and fun to play, the variety with making your character classes is second to none, and the story was actually way better than I ever thought it would be. But seriously, the characters and amount of variety in how to approach each battle is ridiculous. I played this on Honour Mode and got the platinum in one playthrough, so I had to seriously prepare for every fight, and it made it so much more fun. I would recommend this game to anybody easily. The writing is also hilarious and witty. I did get platinum.

8.) The Surge - 7.3/10

This is a sci-fi souls-like game that is actually fairly solid. My issues with it are the bland environments (for the most part) and the lack of variety between the different areas you progress to throughout the game. Each area looks the same as the last & it wears on you for sure. The combat is where the game shines and targeting limbs to chop off in order to get new armor is a great idea. I liked it, but it needed polishing and more variety badly. The story is above average though for those who like dystopia and sci-fi. I did get the platinum.

9.) Guacamelee! 2 - 7.5/10

There’s nothing really wrong with this game, and it’s a cute Metroidvania, but it doesn’t improve much from the first game. It’s one dimensional which isn’t really a huge problem when it’s just stupid fun to hack and slash your way through the game with a Mexican wrestler flare. Idk, I just didn’t enjoy the story enough, characters, or gameplay to rate it higher and nothing about the game really sticks out in my mind, but it’s still fun. I did get platinum. 

10.) Claire - 2/10

This game is bad. It’s basically a pixel horror game where you play as a girl who checks a million doors that all look the same to progress to different rooms that all look the same. I only got through it by staring at a guide and forcing myself to finish it. There’s nothing good to say about it - story sucked, gameplay was non-existent, and it was bland AF. I did get platinum...somehow 

11.) Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End - 7.7/10

I think from a standpoint of being visually beautiful and having polished gameplay, this game should be rated higher. But compared to Uncharted 2, which is my favorite uncharted game, I think the story, characters, and environments were actually pretty lackluster. I don’t regret playing it by any means and it does do a good job of wrapping up the series, but I’m not in love with it. It’s above average, but it’s about as generic of a Indiana Jones shooter as you could get. I did get platinum.

12.) Shadow of the Colossus - 8.2/10

This is the hardest game of the whole list for me to rate. I never played this game on the earlier consoles, so I found the graphics to be gorgeous, and I have never had quite an experience in gaming like this before. The game is undoubtedly unique. The intense silence, the gargantuan boss fights, it all works. Hell, even the boss fight where you have to swim underwater with the electric colossus was scary to me. The only reason I can’t rate the game higher is I don’t like the story, and the controls were infuriating at times. Other than that, it’s a beautiful experience. I did get platinum.

13.) Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition - 9.2/10

I think I’m in the minority here, but I actually liked the first game better. This game is still absolutely amazing, but I liked the less serious tone of the first game & the story better. This game has even MORE variety than the 1st one as far as classes & how to go about fighting/combat which was amazing. I seriously can’t recommend these 2 games enough to those who haven’t played them & I would give Honour Mode a try - I did it again for this game and it makes each fight so intense and require a lot of planning. I did get platinum. 

14.) Darksiders 3 - 8.3/10

So I know that a lot of people did not enjoy this game, but my experience was that of a pretty decent Souls-like game. The combat was enjoyable, the bosses were fun to fight, and the RPG element was just enough to keep me going. I thought the pacing was also above average and I enjoyed how the game had a Metriodvania aspect to it too - you get new upgrades which are used to go back to older areas and unlock secrets or progress to new places. Also, the environments were cool and each area felt very different from the last which is a huge must for me. I liked it enough to even do a second playthrough. I did get platinum. 

15.) Final Fantasy XV - 6.1/10

This was such a strange feeling game for me. The open world gives the word bland new meaning, and the game has horrid pacing issues. The characters, in my opinion, were actually quite good but the story was whack and it made the game damn near impossible to get into. There were some parts I liked - the music was good and made me feel some nostalgia that I’m not even sure where it comes from, and the hunts were actually kinda fun. The combat was something I also enjoyed because once you understand parrying and you stop button mashing, it’s actually pretty unique. The game annoyed me in too many other ways to rate it any higher or to ever want to play it again though. I did get platinum. 

16.) Life is Strange 1 - 8.4/10

I liked it. Despite the occasional annoying teen angst that’s constantly thrown in your face by the characters, it still had enough charm to make me want to finish. It also had a dark side that I didn’t expect and I enjoyed. I wouldn’t go through it again to see what other choices do to impact the story, but I did like it a lot as a visual novel movie type game. I got platinum. 

17.) Dragon Age Inquisition w/ DLC - 8.6/10

So I have to preface my rating with the fact that I’m really into fantasy games & RPG’s, so this was a game I SHOULD really like. My favorite parts were the characters and how deep you could interact with all of them, the combat in terms of the different classes and abilities + the way you could fight in real time or slow things down and make it turn based, and the beautiful environments. I thought the story was weak and that’s pretty much the only reason why I’m not rating it higher. Well, also I didn’t find the RPG aspects to be that good as far as equipment and stuff. The DLC is solid too and I enjoyed that except for The Trespasser. I got platinum and it took a while lol.

18.) Greedfall - 6.8/10

I went into this game not knowing what the hell to expect. What I got was a game that seemed a little confused on what it was. The dialogue options and choices on how to progress through the game was my favorite aspect, but the lack of enemy variety was crazy bad, the combat in general was weak, and the characters were...not memorable. Also, the graphics were beautiful but each area looked the exact same as the last so what should have felt adventurous was ruined by these things. It sucks because this game could have been so much fun, but it was just barely average. I’ll never get over the fact there were like 3 different kinds of enemies total. I did get platinum, and that sucked! 

19.) Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon - 7/10

This game wasn’t bad, but it just felt incomplete. It’s just a precursor game to Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night which I loved & I appreciated the developer even making this one, but I found it hard to get into. I think I’m not that into 8 bit type graphics anymore and I found some of the platforming to be infuriating. It’s decent for $5 but I would not pay more. I got all the trophies but there is no platinum. 

20.) Until Dawn - 9.5/10

I’m starting to realize based on my rankings that I really like the movie-type games. This one in particular had a ton of different choices and they all influenced which of the characters would survive or die in a very interesting “butterfly effect” way. I enjoyed the story a LOT and I didn’t really mind the teen angst because the game was trying to be a silly slasher horror movie so I found it funny. The QTEs were actually terrifying as well because messing them up could kill a character. I liked just about everything with this game and part of that is because I like horror movies. I played this alone, but I would imagine it being best to play with friends. I got platinum.

21.) Final Fantasy VII Remake - 10/10

Okay sooo I’m not even that big of a Final Fantasy fan. I’ve only played FFXV, FF1, FF2, & FF3. I think next I will play FFIX. Anyways, this game was a masterpiece to me. I’ve never played a game that had better pacing in my life, the story was actually understandable for a FF game and to me, was great, the combat was fun and challenging (especially on hard mode), and the boss battles were epic. The characters are also my favorite for any JRPG, but maybe for any game I’ve ever played. Tifa, Cloud, and Aerith mesh so well together and I enjoyed watching Cloud soften up as the game went on. It’s just hard for me to put into words what it was about this game that gripped me so tightly and made me never want to put it down - could be the gorgeous graphics, the different immersive environments, the beautiful music, the great pacing, the varied combat, the lovable characters....I can’t wait for part 2! I got platinum. 

22.) Nioh 2 - 9.6/10

The Souls games & Bloodborne are my favorite games of all time, and Nioh 1 fell right into that niche as well. Nioh 2 is basically just Nioh 1, but improved & with more diverse combat. The story is bare bones but it doesn’t really matter because everything about the game oozes ancient Japan so you get that feeling even with a bare story. The game shines so heavily with its brutal but fair combat. The combat is quick and there are a ton of weapons to have fun with which keeps the experience from ever getting stale. The bosses are some of the best in any game I’ve ever played too. I beat the game solo, but I’m currently doing the DLC with a friend and we are having so much fun, so you have the option to beat it any way you want. I personally don’t think the game has any weaknesses and I enjoy how there are levels instead of just one big open world - this is because it sets it apart and makes it feel different from the Souls games, which I am fine with. I got platinum. 

23.) Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor - GOTY Edition - 7.1/10

So I’m a huge LOTR fan, and I started off pretty impressed with this game despite it being fairly old. The nemesis system with the orcs and their leaders was something I had never seem before, and I enjoyed the combat because it was just like the Batman games. The problem is this - within an hour of the game you’ve already seen everything it has to offer & things get stale fast. I completed the game because the main missions were quite fun, but all the open word collecting stuff was a slog. I’m not mad I played it, but I can’t ever see myself wanting to do it again & this is keeping me from wanting to play the next game in the series. I got platinum. 

24.) Batman: Return to Arkham: Arkham Asylum - 8.3/10

This is a tough one to rate for me. I played this game on the PS3 in college and I have some really fond memories of beating it with my roommate. I never got platinum back then and the Arkham Asylum collection was $5 so I grabbed it. This time around I still really enjoyed the game, but it’s bare bones compared to what’s out there these days. The map is tiny and all looks the same, the fighting is fun but becomes one dimensional early, and there’s really only one kind of enemy. The story is good however and I’m a sucker for collecting the Riddler clues, and I like the biographies they do for all the villains...so that’s why I still rated it pretty highly. I did get the platinum. 

25.) Batman: Return to Arkham - Arkham City - 8.7/10

This is really similar to my rating for Arkham Asylum. I played this game in college with the same roommate and it’s definitely a major step up from Asylum in terms of environment and how big of a game it is now. The city looks great, and the boss fights are a little better, but other than that, it’s the exact same game. I do enjoy these, but it’s easy to get burnt out because it’s pretty much the same thing from minute 1 of playing it if that makes sense. I would recommend it to anyone, but don’t play these back to back. That was a mistake I made! I did get platinum. 

26.) Ratchet & Clank - 8/10

This is a silly game that’s just not quite as good as some of the previous Ratchet & Clank games in my opinion. The guns are fun as always, but I didn’t really like the worlds or story as much as some of the other games in the series. I enjoyed my time with it but can’t say I ever want to replay it. If you know Ratchet & Clank games, this one is the most classic bare bones and safe one in the series. I got platinum. 

27.) Mortal Shell - 8.5/10

Ahhh this game is so hard to rate. It’s a souls-like with some new mechanics that I really enjoyed. It’s very hard in the beginning until you get some sweet new shells and then it becomes easy. In order to get platinum, you need to play the game without a shell (basically 1 hit and you’re dead), and that was a wild experience. The game is quite beautiful aesthetically in a dark way, and aside from one area I absolutely hated, it’s a damn good game. The pacing is solid, combat is fun, but it does lack somewhat in the enemy variety area. The game has a cool partying mechanic that you can level up - one of the level ups is a bug that upon a successful parry, you plant on your enemy and after some time blows up. Overall, it’s weird as hell and has no problem flaunting it. By the end I was admittedly happy to be done because the no shell run was just that intense, but I could see myself going back in the future to play it. I did get platinum. 

28.) Crash Bandicoot: N Sane Trilogy - 9/10

I played each of the 3 games and got platinum on each separately, but I’m just going to rate them once because they’re all pretty similar in my mind. One could argue that the 1st game is way tougher and less forgiving, but I didn’t experience this. What I experienced was an amazing nostalgic ride into my past and I freakin loved playing through these again. The games ooze my childhood, and I just love the platforming. The bosses are always fun and I like how different each set of levels (the worlds) are from one another. I played these back to back to back and it never got old to me. The games are difficult and that’s notched up even more when you go for the time trials, but I found it to be fair. I’m proud of myself for getting platinum on all 3 of some of my favorite childhood games! 

29.) Code Vein - 7.1/10

This is another one that’s a bit tough to rate because it had some elements that I loved, and some I hated. I loved the combat, the characters, and the story. I hated the level design so so much that it almost ruined the game for me. I also found there to be a bit of a lack of variety to enemies. They look different enough, but most of them fight in the exact same way. There’s one area that is just absolutely heinous in terms of level design, and it made me want to rage quit. And it’s not like the other areas are much better. This anime souls game could have been soooo much more. I got platinum.

30.) Shantae: Half Genie Hero - 8.4/10

Cute little indie platformer that held my attention throughout but it didn’t really leave me wanting more. When it was over, I was happy I experienced it but I was also somewhat happy to be done. You play as a genie who can transform into different animals to progress through the levels & find secrets. I had a lot of fun with the Metroidvania aspects of the game & with the bosses, but for some reason it’s charm wore off by the end. I got platinum. 

31.) Vampyr - 9.6/10 

Ok ok, I doubt many people out there would give this game that high of a score. And I really didn’t expect to. But for me, this game had so much charm and accomplished everything it had set out to do. The choices you had to make were HARD, and the RPG elements were perfect because the writing was just that good. I had a freakin blast talking to all of the NPCs and trying to figure out their dirty secrets. The combat is one dimensional for sure, and there’s not a lot of enemy variety in this game which is clearly something I’ve complained about in other games, but it just never bothered me because exploring London in that time period as a doctor turned vampire was just that fuckin cool. I cant express enough how awesome the conversations are and the voice acting - it’s amazing. The music sets the mood too and it just makes for an emotional/fun rollercoaster ride of a game. I got platinum. 

32.) Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - GOTY Edition - 10/10

This is my favorite game of all time and this was my 3rd time playing it since it came out because I only needed a few more trophies for platinum. The game is open world in the best way possible. You can interact with the entirety of the world and it’s surroundings, and the quests are unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. Each separate quest is its own story weaved into the Witcher universe, and the writing is awesome. I’ve read all the Witcher books, and this game falls perfectly in line with what I was imagining. The characters are so easy to like, the enemy variety is stunning, and it has one of the most complex bestiaries in any game which was a bonus for a nerd like me. The DLC is just absurdly good too - Blood & Wine could be a stand alone game - Touissant is vibrant and beautiful and the fairytale land was so cool. Heart of Stone was shorter, but the story was amazing and I loved all the new characters. I could write a book on how much I love this game but I’ll move on. I got platinum. 

33.) The Surge 2 - 8/10

This is basically the first one but with an added combat mechanic called directional parrying, and with more diverse environments/areas. Directional parrying was really fun and I don’t know of any other game that has it other than Sekiro - Sekiro did it a little better but this was still pretty cool. I thought the story in this game wasn’t as strong but there are some decent side quests & it’s a strong enough Souls-like so that’s why I gave it a high score. The areas were pretty confusing again though so I would recommend loosely following a guide of some sort. I got platinum.

34.) The Last of Us 2 - currently playing 

The Last of Us 1 is in my top 5 games along with the Dark Souks trilogy/Bloodborne & The Witcher 3. I’m probably 10 hours into this one and I have to admit, I’m not liking it nearly as much yet. The story is moving in some weird direction so far and I’m just not getting the same amazing vibes that gave me the chills like the first one did. So anyways, just hoping it gets better because I saw it just won GOTY.

kdxovf,xboxone,Dealing with Microsoft has been the worst Customer Service experience I've ever dealt with. And I work in customer service.,"Buy your xbox from a store. Trust me. The ""customer service"" i've had to deal with this past week is unforgiveable, and I'll still be dealing with it tomorrow. Here's the rundown:

\- Purchased a series x from the microsoft online store on 11/9

\- Microsoft pre authorizes me for the series x upon check out, to be processed at least four days before I am to receive the xbox on 12/23

\- Microsoft pre authorized me 8 more times, locking me out of my bank card twice (I was able to unlock it both times by authorizing their 8 pre auths). Every time I am pre authorized I am refunded for the original pre authorization a day or two later. This means the pre authorizations pile up until I no longer have money in the account, and then it locks the card.

\- I call Microsoft to make sure that I still have the order and tell them whats going on. They tell me that this is a bug in the system due to reservations on the 9th and the 10th of November. They tell me that everything is fine and I am set to receive my xbox on the 23rd as originally planned, and that the purchase will process four days before the 23rd, and I am assured that I will get my xbox on the 23rd.

\- Two days later the only email I receive from Microsoft is that my series x order has been cancelled. I check online and sure enough it's gone. I contact microsoft and they say that I will receive the email to repurchase the xbox shortly, and sorry for the inconvenience.

\- Four days later I have not received any email. I contact Microsoft and they tell me that the department I contacted does not deal with this kind of thing (strange because the last two representatives told me about the email and checked into the account just fine). They tell me that they'll transfer me to the correct department. The department they transfer me to is closed, and only open from 9am - 6pm GMT. GMT. ITS ONLY OPEN GMT.

\- I call again, now furious, and ask to speak to a manager. The rep tells me that he is one of the managers in house and he will help me immediately. He asks for my number in the event that the call drops or disconnects. He says he's going to put me on hold. I am on hold for five minutes before i hear ""the office is now closed. we are open from 9 to 6pm GMT. Thank you"" and the phone hangs up. I wait to get a call back. They never call.

&#x200B;

Buy your xbox when its back in stock in store. DO NOT deal with Microsoft over the phone or by purchasing directly from them. I'm just thankful that I didn't already receive my series x with some kind of defect and have to deal with sending it back to get a replacement.

So I went home, looked at my local store to see if I could order the X but wasn't surprised when I was met with the ""Out of Stock"" message.  


For good measure I also looked up to see if I could order the Series S, knowing full well they have at least 2 in stock I was greeted with the ""out of stock"" message.  


So, how again can we order the X online when the stores never even put their in stock items into the system?

1.Its set at Christmas Eve

2.There are multiple references to the fact that it is Christmas time like trees, the music, the quotes like Twas the night before christmas and I have a machine gun now, ho ,ho ,ho and people wishing John Merry Christmas.

3. The whole plot and plan of Hans Gruber revolves around it being Christmas time...his plan probably wouldnt work if it wasnt Christmas Eve.Let me explain.He wouldnt have been able to round up everyone so easily and so fast if they werent all together for the Christmas party without risking them calling the police.It is also why the first few guards are caught so offguard by John because they had no reason to think anyone had gotten out because it should have been impossible.Also the whole reason John was there was to meet back up with his asstranged wife and kids for Christmas so if it wasnt for it being Christmas he wouldnt have been there

kdy9bp,LifeProTips,"LPT: To synch your outlet timers, set them all to turn on at the same time. Then unplug any early starters until the last one turns on.","I don't know why this just came to me, after my wife's been going crazy trying to get all our Christmas light timers to kick on at the same time for a week. No matter how hard she tried, they were still several minutes off from each other.

So, here's the fix I came up with.

1. Unplug all the timers.
2. Make sure their clocks are all set as close to the current time as you can get.
3. Set them all to turn on at the closest future mark.
4. Plug them all in.
5. When the first one turns on, unplug it immediately.
6. Repeat step 5 until they're all unplugged.
7. Set them all to your intended schedule.
8. Plug them all in again, as quickly as possible.

If you're doing this solo, you'll probably still end up with some noticeable lag but it shouldn't be much. If you've got someone else to help out, you can have them plug in one timer while you plug in another so they're closer to exactly simultaneous.

This may result in your lights turning on/off a little off-schedule from the precise time you wanted, but they'll all at least be doing so at around the same time."
kdyae4,xboxone,"CD Projekt Red Clears Up 'Misconceptions,’ Says No Special Refund Policy In Place For Cyberpunk 2077","Investors twice asked CDPR to clarify what was going on with refunds, concerned about how they might impact the game’s sales. The company isn’t ready to say how many refunds have been processed, in part because much of that process is subject to Sony and Microsoft’s refund rules.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“One has to understand: Microsoft and Sony have refund policies for every product that is released digitally on their storefronts,” said SVP of business development, Michał Nowakowski. “Despite several articles I’ve seen that things are being set up just for us, it’s actually not true – these policies are in place and have always been in place; they’re not offered specifically for us.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He went on:

>Anyone who has purchased any title on the PlayStation network or the Microsoft storefront can ask for a refund, and if it’s made within certain boundaries, usually related to time, usage and so on, can ask for that refund. Our procedure here with Microsoft and Sony is not different than with any other title released on any of those storefronts. I want to state that clearly, as there seem to be certain misconceptions.

kdyaqp,Games,"Are AAA studios wildly understaffed, compared to what they would need to never crunch?","""Understaffed"" here could mean one of two things -- either they need more developers period, or they have enough developers but not enough talented developers -- or some combination of both.

If it was just one studio that was known for periods of extreme crunch, you could say maybe their management is uniquely bad at doing things on time. But when it happens at almost every studio, over and over, and many of the resulting games come out to critical acclaim... it strains credulity that ""management is just bad."" 

It seems a lot more plausible that management knows exactly what it's doing, and that they're simply taking some kinds of shortcuts that result in crunch behavior. 

My own work experience tells me that even financially successful companies would sooner engage in criminal behavior than hire enough people to do the work responsibly and legally.

kdygja,cyberpunkgame,Some very simple helpful information for planning your builds,"Here's some information I wish I had when starting my first character. Very simple stuff. Simplest TLDR at the bottom.

**Attribute Points:** Every new character starts with 7 points to work with. Additionally, you will receive 49 points from leveling. This leaves you with a total of **56** attribute points. The base starting score for any attribute is **3**, meaning maximizing an attribute to **20** will take **17** points. With your **56** points, **you can maximize three attributes to 20 with 5 points left over**.

**Skill Progression:** Each attribute has two or three associated skills. For example, Technical Ability has both Crafting and Engineering skills. **A skill's maximum level is capped at the level of its associated attribute.** If your Technical Ability is 3, your crafting can't progress past 3. You level up a skill by using it, and leveling up skills provide rewards. Cold Blood, for example, provides 10% crit chance at level 2. **Each skill provides perk points at various levels of mastery, totaling 7.** There are three exceptions to this -- both Intelligence skills and Crafting only provide 6 skill points for maxing them. This also means that Body and Reflexes provide more perk points than the other attributes. **Body and Reflexes provide a total of 21 perk points, Cool provides 14, Technical Ability 13, and Intelligence 12.**

**Perk Points:** Through leveling your character from 1 to 50, you acquire **49** perk points. Each skill provides **6 or 7** perk points through leveling it to 20. **You may reset your perk points for 100,000 eddies at any ripperdoc.**

**TLDR:** You get **56** total attribute points, meaning **you can max three attributes**. You get **49** perk points from leveling, and **7** from maxing most skills. **Body and Reflexes provide a total of 21 perk points from maxing their associated skills, Cool provides 14, Technical Ability 13, and Intelligence 12.**"

One thing I’ve noticed with the newest models of *most* cars is that the interiors look and feel very cheap.

Some people suggest that banishment would have been sufficient. But how do you know his persistent bitterness and resentment of Michael’s success and status wouldn’t have caused him to turn traitor again, and maybe bribe some bodyguards to finish off Michael?

Killing Fredo was undeniably harsh, but what choice did Michael really have?"

If I could just set up one key to always paste the copyright information it would make this so much easier. Is there a way to do this?  The problem is currently it's always being taken off the clipboard because I need to copy a new record number. 

I've googled this and looks like there might be some ways to do it if I downloaded some software (which isn't a good solution because I need to get that signed off by IT and it would probably take weeks). This seems so simple though, I can't believe it's not an option already in Windows.

Others, don’t say who they are, or where they are from and start rambling on or say who they are and immediately get into the problem they’re having or what they need. 

In my experience (and I’m sure it’s others also) we need to record certain details of the call such as name, product information (serial number etc), contact info and so on, so supplying us the information upfront with no rush makes documenting things much easier. 

Giving us your name voluntarily helps especially if there’s previous notes on the same product, and makes it feel like a bit more of a conversation, especially if we’re asked how the day is going etc especially when there are 20 calls backed up it’s nice to have a bit of a breather, even if it’s just for 5 seconds."

If you’re looking for a gift for literally anyone check out the jewelry counter at winners and you can find some really nice stuff for really discounted prices.

kdztpv,windows,"Windows 10 network connectivity keeps dropping, wired and wireless","Ok, so this is a bit of a stumper. Using an Eluktronics laptop, very nice system, rock-solid for a good, long time. My wife has a Dell Inspirion. We are both experiencing weird behaviors with Windows 10. Connected to wifi, connected to ethernet, no internet. 

My laptop uses an intel dual-band AC 8265 card that handles the ethernet and wifi. 

We have wifi in the back of the house with an extender but I use an ethernet over powerline adapter and run ethernet directly to the computer because wifi is a little too wonky for work connections. 

What I'm experiencing now is wifi will drop out intermittently. My ethernet will do the same thing. Rebooting the computer brings it back. 

So I did the usual of uninstall the adapter, let it autodetect again, update the drivers, delete it and the drivers and add them back in, flush DNS and reset ipv4 and ipv6, no good. I even got an additional USB wifi adapter to see if maybe it's just a driver conflict and it won't connect, either. If I connect the laptop directly to the router the speed is fast, when it works. But sometimes it'll refuse to see the router without a reboot. 

Meanwhile, while these Windows machines have trouble connecting, I have zero problem with our cell phones, chromebook, television with rokus, all of them connect to the wifi just fine. 

So, given that the problem is limited to Windows machines, my suspicion is that there's something going wrong pending a Windows update and I think the problem is inherent to Windows since it's failing wifi and ethernet on the same card and fails for the usb wifi as well. 

Someone pointed out that there's a hidden item in device manager that's the microsoft tool for adding hotspots. Kill it and that can resolve some issues but it didn't work for me.

kdzyg3,gaming,CYBERPUNK 2077 - My first impression,"Good morning Night City! Another fellow gamer here, sharing their first impression of the game with you guys. So you bought Cyberpunk? You got CYBERPUNKED! Just kidding, the game’s pretty amazing. It is living up to all the hype. I have no idea why the game devs are apologizing.  They took on a pretty big project with massive potentials, and there is always room for updates and patches, so no big loss. I rather play the game now, than a year later.

\- The game has a lot of visual detail so far, but I feel like there isn’t much I can interact with (other than vending machines, which are literally everywhere). 

\- The in-game music is amazing, which makes me question why the Sound Track CDs were so bad. It’s like they just copy and paste one song into 2 CDs. 

\- The crafting system seems complicated but I’ll get around to it. A lot of skills, items, attributes and perks to play with. 

\- The combat is a bit tough, even on easy mode but that’s mostly because everyone in the game has armored implants, so it’s like defeating machines. One bullets doesn’t do it anymore.

\-  I noticed a floating cheeseburger in my travels, and also my car seemed to have the hiccups but nothing a patch or two can’t fix. 

\- The game has great potential for player housing, futuristic card game, and PVP.

\- The radio station on loading screen was pretty smart, but so far I’ve been getting the same news. 

\- The game is really violent and some of the scenes give you the rush

Overall, I give the game a 9/10. Looking forward to updates and DLCs. 07"

ke08xz,CDProjektRed,"the free ""DLC"" and ""endings"" ATENTION: no spoilers ahead","for the ""full game"" of cyberpunk 2077 once you get to the end of it all but one of the endings feel like ""open books"" (meaning it doesn't feel like the end but more like a beginning of something ).

The DLC in the near future aren't new missions (well there would be new missions obviously :T ) they're the next acts. Which brings up some questions. Would there be a choice of which ""ending"" to go off of or will it just continue after you get the ending?

In my play through of the game at a ""ripper doc"" when I go to upgrade some things in a slot there isn't any cyberware in that slot so I wonder if they haven't put that stuff in yet ( in other words: BE!! PAITENT!! and wait till CD red puts in the missing stuff >:T ) speaking of cyberware I wonder if there would be grapple claws and scissor hands ( I know they won't put that in because non of my ideas would come to light but it would be nice plus I wouldn't care if they say it was there idea first I would just be happy that it existed in the game <:) )

As for some other cyberware ideas how about ""blast triple jump"" (it's like the double jump but after the third jump your legs will shoot whoever's under you it might even work with a slide too ;3 ) there can be even cheetah legs that'll make you run fast as a sports car, as for spider palms they'll go in the slot where the ammo counter thing goes.

The spider palms would have the ability to allow you to climb walls like a spider.

Speaking of animal cyberware I wonder if that's what that glitchy stat slot is. ( in your stats there's a slot that when you hover the curser over it that slot bugs out ) meaning in the near future we could get cat ears and tails :3 also tattoo parlors, plastic surgeons, makeup stores and barber shops/ salons.

I for one hope there's a mission where you fight on-top of a moving truck or train that would be an awesome and epic mission. =\^W\^=

As for CD red keep up the great work and take your time kay? We can wait for the next ""DLC""s          (ACTs ;3 ) to come out so don't rush and take your time ok? And thank you for making great games keep up the great work you guys ;)"

ke0iyw,movies,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) Demonstrates just how Razor-Thin the Line is Between Being a Stinker and a Holiday, Pop-Culture Classic.","

I recently rewatched How the Grinch Stole Christmas - the one with Jim Carrey. Possibly for the first time i actually *watched* the movie as an adult. 

I, like many of you, have seen the movie countless times, whether it be playing at my house as kid, a Christmas party, in grade-school, in college (we actually watched this movie in my Theories of Personalities class) or just in the background during Christmas time - but never really paid attention to it. 

Anyways, I just sat down and watched it again and wow - The movie is just kinda *meh* and a little creepy. I thought to myself, ""If anyone else knew i didn't like this movie, I would be put on a very naughty list.""

I was sure this movie was rated highly on Rotten Tomatoes so I looked it up. (Rotten by users and critics)[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_the_grinch_stole_christmas]

Goddamn I was not expecting that. They must have made a ton of money on the movie thought right? 

(Nope, doubled their budget)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_(2000_film)]

Following in the footsteps of How The Grinch Stole Christmas, three years later The Cat in the Hat is released.

They seem to follow the same formula:

Legendary Dr. Seuss book

Whacky comedian Mike Meyers replaces Jim Carrey following his incredible success with Shrek. 

Relatively unknown cute blonde kid Dakota Fanning replaces relatively unknown cute blonde kid Taylor Momsen.


....and it's heralded as one of the (*worst* movies of all time)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat_(film)#Critical_response]. 

We are talking single-digit Rotten Tomato scores and breaking even on budget. 


The phenomenon is that even though How the Grinch Stole Christmas isn't regarded as good movie but really any review, ratings, or box office scores, at this point it's truly blasphemous to say you dont like How the Grinch Stole Christmas. There's no metric for that, but try it. Try it at your family Christmas-whatever.

Look at these headlines:

(Masterpice-Buzzfeed)[https://www.buzzfeed.com/alliehayes/how-the-grinch-stole-christmas-is-a-masterpiece]

(GOAT Christmas movie-Metro)[https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/16/5-reasons-the-grinch-is-the-best-christmas-movie-of-all-time-7040462/]

(Best Netflix Christmas Movies-NME)[https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/christmas-films-on-netflix-2588616]

But the Lore is already there in place, the world of westeros is already in place Map in detail and all, it wouldnt take alot of overall creative liberties to bring this to a game, not to mention the increase in capabilities with the new CPUS, the consoles are alot more capable we could seriously have a Amazing Dark fantasy experience on our hands.

ke0kxy,movies,I frankly unabashedly hated Tenet,"All the cinemas where I live were closed because of the lockdown when it arrived. 
I just had the opportunity to see it for the first time and boy... what an awful film. It's in my view Nolan's worst film. 
I love Nolan I think he is one of the best filmmakers working today. Inception, prestige are two of my favourite films of all time. Even films considered flawed like dark knight rises and interstellar I loved but this was a unique specie. It was horrible. 

The word convoluted would be an understatement. We would need to invent a new word. Now I understand what the rejoinder would be. It'd go something like hey Nolan makes his movie in such a way that you need to watch them multiple times to fully comprehend what's going on.(Such was the case with inception as well as interstellar after all)

But the difference here is I was invested in those stories. I was intrigued. They managed to engross me such that when they were over I immediately rewatched them(something I don't usually do) to better understand the concepts and themes of said films yes but also to relive and savour some of their amazing moments

Here I found myself desperately wishing for film to be over and when it did I went to the Wikipedia page to read its plot summary and was barely able to finish it. Even its plot summary proved tedious and immensely boring to read. 
Like what was he thinking? How can he or people at warner bros came to greenlight this garbage of a script?

People were raving about amazing action set pieces but even they were too confusing to follow. And became quickly monotonous.

The only good thing I can say is that it's actors did a good job. I liked Denzel Washington's son, and the score was good. Some scenes in reverse looked visually impressive but for a great film maker like Nolan this is and should be a low-bar.

I hope in the future he spends more time improving his scripts. I hope he does better next time because I want him to make great movies.  He is a gifted artist who seems to legitimately love his craft."

ke0lqg,gaming,"PSA: Last gen console players: if you have problems with Cyberpunk 2077, see if Stadia works for you by simply playing Destiny 2 for free on Stadia. No hidden fees, completely free!","I don't have the latest console or high end PC, and wasn't planning on buying CP 2077 on any platform due to that.

But I tried Destiny 2 on Stadia last month since it is completely free to play (no subscription fee or signup fee or anything), and found that Stadia actually works really well for my internet connection. So this month I bought CP 2077 (also because they were giving away chromcast + controller with the game). I have not had any performance issues so far. 

I hear so many horror stories out there about CP 2077 performance on last gen consoles, and it baffles me that there's this completely viable alternative out there for you guys and it's hardly being mentioned.

It literally takes 10 seconds to link your existing google account with Stadia, and start playing Destiny 2. You have nothing to lose to try it out and see if Stadia works for you.

Then, if Stadia does work for you, now you have a choice of returning the game for your last gen console, and buy it on Stadia instead. Good luck!

(I'm not a shill for google. I was just as shocked as you probably would be when I first tried Stadia.)"
ke0ltt,movies,Was U.S. Marshals an unnecessary sequel to The Fugitive?,"Hello Redditors,

My friends and I are discussing on whether The Fugitive (1993) deserved the average sequel, US Marshals (1998). 

I'm kind of torn on it, I enjoyed both films but honestly, I think it would have been better as a standalone rather than a sequel. One friend specifically thinks that it was a fine sequel, while my other friend thinks it was unnecessary. My father loves US Marshals more than The Fugitive but was unaware that they were related haha.

What did you guys think? I think it would have been better as a standalone kind of like Hobbs and Shaw, I think that movie should have been a stand-alone as well. Speed 2 to me is more of an unnecessary sequel/bad movie."

In the same vein, go for a visit around mid-January. As these items are usually loaded into inventory systems as separate seasonal products, big box stores will often apply a discount without having an actual employee assess the value in an attempt to clear ""Christmas"" stock.

Then I thought, what if the boss actually was me and I had to fight myself. It would be cool to fight a boss that was based on your stats and did everything you did during fights. If you always seek cover, he would always seek cover. If you threw a ton of grenades, you now have to deal with that. Many games provide players with these seemingly random stats (which I actually appreciate), so I can’t imagine it would be too difficult to refer to those stats for particular encounters. 

Top tier players would encounter challenging bosses. Less adept players may realize how poorly they play and potentially become better and actually learn from their doppelgänger.

I have no idea if this concept has been developed in other game, I just thought it was an interesting idea and wanted to share it. If it has never been considered or actioned, maybe this post and input from others can be a seed that finds its way to the folks that can do something productive with it.

ke1h1z,gaming,A Thank You to the Police of Gaming,"After the stress of a truly dystopian world I caught a glimpse of in Cyberpunk 2077 where every officer is either equipped with a teleportation device or just doesn't give a damn at all I just wanted to say thank you to some the most hardball law enforcements of gaming in my memory (please mention your own in the comment section)

\-Thank you to LSPD and LCPD for going making sure I never got the chance for explaining myself before shooting me to hell and especially LSPD for draining my already empty pockets before I could join a friend's heist.

\-Thank you to the Bounty Hunters who'd be on my ass every single damn time I set up camp in the wilderness but always let me have a chance to bitch out and surrender before letting the dogs loose on me.

\-Thank you to Panau Military, Di Ravello Military, and Black Hand for always busting my ass for  blowing up your military bullshit and also showing that driving's just as hard in those games for A.I. as for humans

\-Thank you to the New Bordeaux Police Force for reminding me that being black and driving a car is already suspicious, 1960s or not. Of course a huge thank you to the Empire Bay Police Force for showing impressive restraint before blasting my ass off.

\-Thank you to the City Watch in Dunwall for and sorry to that poor bastard who never got to gather for whiskey and cigars after I cut his head clean off.

I forgot a lot of thanks I know so please help out in the comment section"

I have found very similar games Like ""Arkanoid: Doh it Again""(Console Exclusive) it seems almost the game but just slightly off. i specifically remember it being a pc game. The biggest thing i remember is a boss level with a giant snake similar to Arkanoid, but with higher graphics. ([https://imgur.com/a/GXrVT44](https://imgur.com/a/GXrVT44)) Link to a photo of snake.

ke1p9r,LifeProTips,"LPT: To come off as more friendly and approachable, talk more and in complete sentences","How was your day? Fine. 

Do anything fun over the weekend? Studied for finals. 

It’s easy to answer questions with just as much words needed to answer the question. And nothing more beyond that. It’s quick, efficient and we’re all busy people with places to go and things to do, why speak needlessly amirite?

But here’s the thing. You should speak needlessly, and elaborate your points and speak in complete sentences. Not because it’s the polite thing to do but because people, strangers in particular, come armed with skepticism, fearfulness, and other negative emotions towards you. Because they don’t know you yet. It’s the natural thing to do, to be wary of strangers. They’re in an apprehensive state. 

When you talk in longer answers, you disarm them of some of those negative emotions. They see you relaxed, open and comfortable with conversation. It makes you more approachable and easier to bond with. 

It’s better to talk more than needed. More talking almost always helps whatever situation you’re in."

But in reality, I probably spent just as much time fiddling with drivers etc as I would have with Vista ... which BTW eventually became a great OS.)

Don't hate me for running Ubuntu \[Xubuntu, specifically\]. Or for appreciating Windows 10 as a very fine OS, which I game and music with. (MacOS in great too.)

ke1rtv,movies,No Such Thing,"So, I was motivated to post about this movie because an r/AskReddit post struck gold and got me thinking about immortality. What would I do with it?

I worked in a Blockbuster when No Such Thing came out and rented it out of curiosity. Anything that was small budget and had an interesting synopsis, I watched. I was extra curious because of the presence of Helen Mirren and Sarah Polley (thanks Baron Munchausen!) She was in Dawn of the Dead later but that's beside the point.

During this period of time, I watched so many amazing movies. This one has stuck with me. Partially because Robert John Burke (of Robocop 3 fame at the time) was in the starring role. And partially because the story was just so damn cool and unique.

If  you haven't seen it and have an appreciation for weird, independent movies, check it out. It's one of those random gems that flew by most people. If you have seen it, let me know what you dug about it. I have a genuine love for the quirkiness of this movie and really just want others to share in that experience if they haven't seen it."

Trying to track it down for inspiration for a project. Any help/pointers to that or even some other movie with a similar recurring theme would be great.

ke206x,LifeProTips,LPT: Trouble getting out of bed in the morning? Leave your alarm across the room from your bed.,"This one has been huge for me. Ive gone back and forth in doing this but I always appreciate how easy it is to get going in the morning when i get out of bed for my alarm. I generally try to wake up an hour before I have to walk out my door. This way I have plenty of time to shower, eat and even get a short workout/stretch in before I head out.

For a while I started to have a difficult time getting up. My phone's alarm would go off, I'd grab it off my nightstand, browse reddit or youtube and then fall right back asleep, only to wake up minutes before I actually needed to get dressed. 

Then I started to leave my phone plugged in on the floor across the room and let me tell ya, it made a huge difference in not only my mornings, but my entire day. I was able to cook a full breakfast, get dressed, make a lunch and still have around 30 min to spare in order to relax a bit and enjoy a hot cup of coffee before starting my commute. 

If you want to wake up a little earlier to have a nicer pace your mornings, give it a try!"
ke21am,xboxone,180 Local Multiplayer Games from 36 Different Genres,"There are more local multiplayer games than ever, but most are indie games overshadowed by AAA titles. I can't comment exactly on many new games the Xbox One has been getting each month, but I do know the PS4 has been getting about 60 new games a month in 2020 - 28% of which include local multiplayer - but most people only hear about a handful of them. I imagine it's pretty similar for the Xbox One. **I’m going to list 5 local multiplayer games per genre.** I’m setting a limit because I will just keep going for some genres if I don’t. They will be in order of highest quality game to lowest quality. I had no problems finding games for each genre – almost all should have a Metacritic rating over 70%, with only a few exceptions (like Outward, but patches have improved it).

Some games can really qualify for two genres, like Fury Unleashed, which is both a run & gun and roguelike. If this happens, I either pick the one it leans more strongly towards, or I just choose. No game will ever appear more than once on this list.

***Notes About the List***

•      Resident Evil 6 and Revelations 2 also have local co-op. 6 reviewed quite a bit worse than 5, but still performed well overall. Revelations 2 plays differently from 5 and 6 - there is more environmental puzzle solving, and at times the second player uses a flashlight instead of a gun. It still performed almost as well as 5, but you should note it's not really a shooter like the other two games.

•       Trine 1, 2, and 4 are 2D games. Trine 3 is a 3D game and reviewed significantly worse than the other two. That said, Trine 3 still performed somewhat decently.

•       Lethal League Blaze is a sequel to Lethal League. The first one is slightly less expensive, but the sequel is generally considered to be better in nearly every way.

•      Guns, Gore & Cannoli 1 & 2 scored about equally well. In addition to the campaign mode, the first one also has an arena type battle mode that is not present in the sequel. The sequel has a more robust moveset with dodges and jumps. The sequel also has online play and is slightly more expensive than the first one.

•      AO Tennis 2 reviewed significantly better than the first game, but it is also more than twice as expensive as the first game.

•      WWE 2K has a number of entries on Xbox One, but WWE 2K19 reviewed the best. WWE 2K20 reviewed significantly worse than all the other games in the series.

Hope this helps you find something new to play. Obviously there are tons of great ones that didn’t even make the list, including Crawl, Lichtspeer: Double Speer Edition, Death Road to Canada, N+, Broforce, Metal Slug (series), Bleed 1 & 2, 9th Dawn II, The Escapists 2, Super Toy Cars 1 & 2, Woodle Tree 2, Old Man's Journey, Hellpoint, Riptide GP 2 & Renegade, Cannon Brawl, Totally Reliable Delivery Service, Guilt Battle Arena, STAB STAB STAB!, Mugsters, Die For Valhalla!, Hookbots, FoxyLand 2, Pang Adventures, Screencheat, Laser League, etc. With the indie scene continually expanding, I expect even more on the Xbox Series S/X!"

ke2arl,gaming,Cyberpunk = Borderlands.,"Honestly, I enjoy the game. But ij describing it to someone today I realized something-- it's not like Witcher, Deus Ex, or other RPGs.

This game feels like fucking Borderlands. It's a shoot and loot with very loose RPG elements that all railroad you through the same storyline regardless of choices. 

Now, is Borderlands a fun game? Hell yeah. BL2 is one of my favorites of all time. But it is not some open world rpg city simulation with 4 different types of AI doing real time responsiveness to player actions, which is what I get the impression CDPR had hyped for years.

So... If you haven't gotten Cyberpunk yet and are thinking about it, change your expectations. It's a beautiful (on PC) shoot n loot with some fun stealth mechanics, some skill tree customization for combat, and some mediocre combat AI that really only poses a threat when it's a boss or outlevels you... Kinda like Borderlands. 

Hope this helps someone out there."

This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.

ke2lwl,gaming,Are consoles undervalued compared to PC?,"I feel like there's a lot of upside to console gaming that people tend to brush over these days.

1. Games are often better optimized for console meaning you get more ""bang for your buck"" in terms of performance and visuals.

2. Some of the best games still end up being console exclusive. Look at PS4's library for example which probably has at least 5 or 6 of the best games this gen as exclusives.

3. The tech inside PS5 and Series X are seriously impressive and make it easy to invest in one over a gaming PC. We're at the point again where console hardware provides great value for the price which couldn't really be said of PS4 and Xbox One. 4K@60fps, raytracing, 120fps on some titles is very impressive for the $400-$500 price tags.

4. PC GPUs are ridiculously expensive right now (and have been for a few years) making investment in a console a more attractive option. Yes you can still get better performance out of a PC but it's going to cost you significantly more for an RTX 30 series card for example.

5. Unified library and services. No dealing with 8 different clients or digital libraries like on PC. Unified friend's lists and achievements on console, etc.

6. Less troubleshooting and tech issues on console. The overall experience on console is incredibly optimized these days. PC has become more much user friendly, especially for gaming, but there's still plenty that can go wrong with random tech issues, driver incompatibility, Windows 10 acting up, etc.

Last gen I would have told anyone without a thought to build a gaming PC over a PS4 or Xbox because of how weak the console hardware was. But now with how big of upgrades PS5 and Series X provide I actually think the gap between them and PC is much closer.

ke3b4j,movies,For anyone that complains about main characters making stupid decisions — watch Run.,"One of my biggest pet peeves in movies is when the supposedly smart protagonist makes a ludicrously stupid decision because that was the only way the writers could think to move the plot along; or conversely, an objectively dumb character wins the day because of unbelievable plot contrivances. Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by *Run* a Hulu film made by the same directing duo behind *Searching* (a great mystery-thriller from a few years ago). For those who don’t know, the film is about a sheltered teenage girl afflicted by numerous health conditions who begins to suspect that her mother is fabricating and causing her illnesses to keep her vulnerable and in constant need of care. Now while I don’t think the film is perfect (I generally take issue with the motivations of the mother), I think the daughter, Chloe, is one of the best recent examples of a smart protagonist who constantly makes decisions that are both understandable and actually reasonable in her attempt to escape her situation. The film very smartly establishes that as a sheltered, homeschooled child, Chloe has built up a lot of hobbies and that require a specific and unique set of skills, and then lets each of these skills serve a specific purpose in the escape from her mother. This makes all of her decisions and the subsequent plot reveals feel earned, and never contrived for the sake of moving the story along. Furthermore, whenever possible, Chloe chooses caution over results, making sure she isn’t caught by her mother, which is a very natural and relatable reaction to her situation. She is in a position of weakness and uncertainty so it’s understandable that she doesn’t take unnecessary risks. What makes the film even more compelling is that her mother is frequently a step ahead of her, making it a real battle of wits between the two for Chloe to win. And frequently, Chloe’s clever solution to a problem is stymied because her mother has an explanation and/or plan for everything. Ultimately, this film is a thrill to watch because it leverages our natural capacity for fear and anxiety while never asking us to break our suspension of disbelief when one of the two main characters gain the upper-hand, which is a sorely missing aspect from most modern thrillers. I’d love to hear what people think about this film, as it’s a surprise favorite of mine this year."

ke3fkx,gaming,We are all at fault for Cyberpunk – and many other games that fell short,"I am posting this in /r/gaming because this is my personal general reflection on the state of the game industry, including the fans, using Cyberpunk as a primary (but not the single) example.

This post is inspired by this image https://i.redd.it/8f2j1dtxk2561.jpg (apologies to the OP, I cannot find the thread) and the general ongoing discussion of missing features in /r/cyberpunk.

At first, I saw that image and I thought “wow, that is an embarrassment for CRPR” but after I thought about it a bit more I realized that 90% of those things have 0% impact on gameplay. Then I started looking through the /r/cyberpunk threads and really started to realize how impossible the game was to obtain based on fan expectations. 

Posts like: it’s not an RPG because I can’t customize my apartment, it’s not an open world game because it doesn’t have a police system, it’s not X Y or Z because of some arbitrary thing I want. And it gets way worse, all the way down to it takes me 3 space bars instead of one to load the game https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/ke1fxk/starting_the_game_is_needlessly_long_in_the/ . Can we please go back to complaining about the 5 mins of stupid unescapable ads at the start of games instead of three space bars?

I need to upgrade / customize my apartment? Why? Of the games that allowed that how many times did you realistically go back there? We need dirty cars and car washes? Why? We need a tiered loot system? Why? It sucked in diablo, and it doubly sucks now – Ghost Recon removed it from the game and now it’s 100% better. When is the last time you really though to yourself “oooh I hope I get to play the inventory spread sheet game for the 100 millionth time”. We want 17 different character backgrounds to play the story only 1 time? Why? We need 1000 different activities in an open world game… really? Do you really? How many times did you go back and play poker in RDR? Really? How many times to do you stop for some stupid fetch quest in whatever game? Only once now right?

Now there is no denying that the delivered quality of RDR2 is far better than CP but you can easily make the argument that both games are just as shallow when it comes to the actual gameplay; And while all those nice to haves add to the realism of the game world they shouldn’t come at the cost of fun and should be added only when the true game is really done. 

Disco Elysium is probably the best RPG this year, I didn’t see anyone complaining about the fact that they can’t change their hairstyle, couldn’t customize their ride, etc.

I didn’t see anyone complaining about a lack of loot in Doom Eternal… Id made the best fun FPS in years (seriously go play it) because they were precise on what they wanted to accomplish and ignored all the BS fan noise. 

It’s also worth pointing out that Rockstar delayed the PC version (under great fan protest) so they could concentrate on one single delivery. Something CDPR should have obviously done – that’s clearly a management / financial thing but in retrospect the right decision – ship on whatever platform first then figure out the rest. 

The point of all of this is that the fans are putting too much pressure on devs to deliver every single feature of the last great game and more… it’s impossible to obtain. The laundry list of shit that devs “must” include to be a real “open world” / “rpg” is so ridiculous now that a budget of a billion dollars and 2000 developers can’t possibly deliver on it outside of 30 years.

Pro-tip to all future game devs, never, ever, call your game an RPG or Open World. Nothing short of these games being the equivalent to the Matrix is acceptable now? Well, why not? Because they use the words Open World and RPG together? Call your game an Adventure and make whatever the fuck you really want to make – good or bad.

I was a firm believer until recently that devs should take players feedback and incorporate that into their game. I am now starting to think that devs should go back to the old school game dev where they just do what they want in a clean room and for better or worse deliver what they deliver. 

I believe, and I could be wrong, but I believe if CDPR made the game they wanted to make and not they game everyone wanted them to make it would be far better. And that goes for a ton of games recently when they try and follow the same patterns.

Everyone remember Bioshock? How that blew everyone’s minds? We need more of that and not more of the same."

ke3rhi,gaming,"Honest question here about CyberPunk 2077. If you’re considering returning it, why buy it again?","I’m not a gamer by any means but my boyfriend thought I should play it because I loved RDR2 and GTA 5.

ke3sak,gaming,Can somebody explain to me why some many people say The Evil Within 2 is so much better than 1?," I personally don't see it. To me, TEW2:

\- has not as strong boss fights;

\- has no match mechanic;

\- the level design wasn't as interesting, even though it was more open;

\- the most annoying thing to me was the aiming(or the hit detection, or something like this, i'm not sure), that felt really off for some reason, i always felt like i was missing shots i was not supposed to miss(maybe on PC this isn't an issue but on PS4 was really annoying);

\- somehow, the guns didn't feel as satisfying to shoot, even the headshots weren't as satisfying.

\- the horror factor wasn't as strong.

I think the only things TEW2 did better, was the story, presentation and graphics that were way more polished. Mechanics wise, the only thing i think it was better, was that Sebastion controlled more fluidly. I know it sounds like i hate TEW2, but i really liked it, it's that it just wasn't as strong in these areas. What do y'all think, does somebody agree with me?"

Now I’m trying to play a new game and I can’t seem to get into anything. (I have a switch and a PS4 btw). I’ve tried legend of Zelda: BOTW and Mario Odessy and had fun with them for a couple hours each and then just lost interest, I just couldn’t get into them. I also tried the Witcher and Skyrim but it was the same thing, plus they both felt so overwhelming and difficult to learn/follow which I dunno is cause I haven’t played any other games in the Witcher or elder scrolls series. Anyway idk what to do, I just feel a bit stuck and frustrated especially cause I know that these are good games and I should/could love them but I just can’t get into any of them. Should I just have a break from gaming for a while? Try and push through with one of the games I’ve started? Try another game? If anyone has got any suggestions I would really appreciate it.

It might be a writing problem, but it feels like the game gives you the illusion of choice in certain situations. I get it, Johnny is modeled after the beloved Keanu Reeves who is loved by many( i think the individual is great person btw) but the character in the game just really pushes my buttons. A ton of people would go to great lengths to defend the character, but as of now, my view on the character is poor. It makes me like the game a bit less when it forces me to, out of character, for certain missions. Im still going to go through the whole game since I purchased it, just wanted to vent out my frustrations and opinions to anyone who wants to listen, thanks!"

Story is great, visually it's stunning(am on PC), characters are great whom I cared about, some side missions are actually better than main quests (hoped for that being a Witcher 3 fan and CDPR didn't disappoint). I didn't sell into too much hype and except an odd trailer here or there, never cared about what would be in the game. Can't be disappointed when you don't put expectations,so don't really know what got cut. Pre ordered the game(the first time in my life) and will pre order CDPR games again. For someone who is disappointed with games flooded by stupid DRM, having stopped buying games from big AAA companies like EA, Bethesda, Ubisoft, R*, Capcom etc, AC Origins was the last AAA I bought which was severely disappointing and insulting to the RPG genre. CDPR still makes me happy being a PC gamer."

ke4ylt,LifeProTips,LPT: Stick cold feet in hot water for a few minutes and put them in warm socks after drying off to make them feel warm for hours,"TL:DR at bottom

So I have what seems to be chronic icy-feet. I've tried everything from wrapping them in three blankets to taking a warm shower to holding them in front of a fireplace to putting on multiple layers of socks, but nothing seems to work well. That is until today, where I had one of the best ideas I think I've ever had. 

I filled my bathtub ankle high with hot water (if you touch it with your hands, it is nice and hot but you can keep your hand in the water without it feeling like it's scalding you) and stood inside it for five to ten minutes. Although my hands could manage it fine, my feet burned like HELL for the first minute or so because they were so cold, and I had to keep taking them out of the water for a few seconds and putting them back in to relieve the burning. After a minute or so, I noticed the burning decreasing a noticeable amount, and it eventually got to the point to where my feet felt the same amount of heat as my hands. This meant that my feet had finally warmed up, so I carefully got out of the tub and dried my feet with a towel, feeling relieved that they finally stopped feeling like ice blocks.

This is where the second part of my idea came in. I had tried the tub thing once before, but I noticed that my feet went back to freezing within an hour or so. However this time, as soon as my feet were warm and dry, I put on a nice pair of warm socks to retain the heat, and it has been working WONDERS. It has been two and a half hours since I put them in the tub, and only now are they starting to go cold again. This has been the best relief I have ever had for them, and I encourage others with cold feet to try this as well!

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Fill bathtub ankle high with hot water (hot, but warm enough that your hand isn't uncomfortable when you stick it in the water). Put your ice-cold feet in the tub and they will burn like crazy for a minute, and the burning sensation will slowly fade away until it isn't there. This is just your feet warming up and receiving thermal energy from the surrounding water. When your feet stop burning, you can take them out of the tub, dry them, and put on some nice, warm socks to retain the heat. Enjoy your now-warm feet for at least a couple of hours!"

ke5fwt,gaming,Search business simulators (1-4 players),"Hey everyone, I would like to play more economic sims, no matter how old they are, they just have to be playable on pc.

I know this is a rather unusual question, but I look forward to your suggestions."
ke5gb6,gaming,People are really exaggerating the PC specs you need to run Cyberpunk well,"I have a Ryzen 3600 and 1660S which are by no means high end components. Seeing people's reactions after the first few days acting like you need an RTX 3080 to make the game playable I legit thought I was going to get like 30fps on low settings.

Anyway after some optimization and tweaking I'm running it on mostly high settings, 1080p@60fps, and it looks amazing. Occasionally get some drops to like 50-55fps but nothing below that.

Point is I think the game is actually very well optimized for PC, especially after the patch they pushed out a couple days ago, and the specs sheet that Nvidia released on launch seems pretty accurate: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/cyberpunk-2077-system-requirements/

PS5

PRO's
• Premium Design & build quality
• Haptic feedback & 3D Audio
• Exclusive Games
• PS Plus Collection ( now i have 120 games in my library which is the equivalent of Gamepass on Xbox, so no reason to buy Xbox at all)
• Powerhouse performance
• 4k sleek & simple UI, Picture in Picture mode
• Ultra fast loading times are a dream
• Dead silent compared to Sony Airlines PS4 Pro Jet 

CON's 

• Random bugs & ocassional crashes in games
• Coil whine from PSU creates a buzzing sound, it's not too disturbing but it's there.
• 32 GBPS limited HDMI bandwith, hope there will be a fix in a future update to allow 40gbps

Do you realize how beautiful it is to be part of something simply because you buy a game on day one? I did it for the first time now, with cyberpunk2077 and... My experience is not as good as I thought it would be. And I am not talking about the game, I am talking about the community, there is so much rage, people is angry (sometimes for good reasons and sometimes not), and now I just want to fade away from all of this and never buy a game at day one again to share something with other people. 

This is my experience but I wanted to know what do you think about it. I mean, buying a game at day one allows you to literally live the real community that plays the game, do you think that is worth it to share with a community that add so much rage in your life? And what is the point of buying at day one and not waiting for the pricetag to drop? (Other than play the game right when it comes out)

ke5jx7,gaming,The test for next gen should be game mechanics more than graphics.,"I hate that companies are concentrating on making games slightly more good looking with better lighting and other details but the gameplay mechanics remain the same.

Games like red dead redemption 2 are really next gen games. The gameplay is so well crafted in terms of walking, shooting etc. Even looting is so well detailed that everything you pick up has its own animation. This game is really a underated gem. Consider GTA San Andreas and GTA 5, even a 6 year old will be able to say which is next gen.

Now let's consider Call of duty 4 modern warfare which came out an eternity ago and call of duty Cold war. They're the same exact game with a few new features which looks better. Battlefield, assassins creed, NFS, they're all the same games. And now it's even worse as companies are remastering old games..what. lol! We're moving backwards.

Ultimately what I'm trying to say is just because the game  just looks better doesn't mean it's ""next gen"" and we has a community need have better standards."

ke5kox,movies,mediocre actors whose careers are largely founded by nepotism?,"First of all I just want to say that nepotism a system not exclusively rampant to the entertainment industry (as in music, Hollywood and even theatre) the legacy admission into an elite university for example, or someone being hired as admin staff at their dad/uncles law firm.   


Nepotism is pretty massive in Hollywood, and like in the professional world, nepotism and being qualified together frequently lead to opportunities. I don't think anyone is going to argue that Daniel Day Lewis isn't a phenomenal actor, but his father Cecil was a respected and knighted poet and so I think it probably opened door for young Daniel that were closed to others. Daniel probably wouldn't still be relevant or lauded if he wasn't actually amazingly talented. 

Lady Gaga is another figure who has similarly fortunate circumstances with extraordinary talent. Germanotta grew up in a penthouse on 5th Avenue with millionaire parents who could afford piano lessons, catholic school and even a guest role on The Sopranos in 2001 when she was 15. Perhaps because of all that privileged breeding she was able to develop her gifts. She has something to say and has been successful in redirecting pop music and even performances and the aesthetic of the late 2000s and early 2010s. Now she is a classic entertainer who will remain in the public consciousness for decades in the vein of Barbra Streisand, Elton John, or Bette Midler. Like Day Lewis, she wouldn't still be relevant if she wasn't actually talented or intelligent about her craft.

I want you to respond with actors who aren't terrible but who have blown you away, people who just give decent performances, but nothing too remarkable. A lot of the time you can chuck this up to typecasting and personalities that are charismatic or that appeal to specific demographics. Who are some people who keep getting roles in spite of not being all that compelling?"
ke5myx,LifeProTips,"LPT: If you are choking, make as much noise as possible.","Bang your fist against a wall, table, door, whatever you can reach. Choking is not obvious, and waving for attention can be easily missed. Going to a bathroom or private place can easily lead you to death. Make a lot of noise, draw attention to yourself. Someone around you may be able to help, or at least call for help. It may be awkward in a public setting, but you are more likely to survive than if you hide. 

If you are alone, you may need to try to get a neighbour’s attention, such as banging on a connecting wall, or their door. It is a much more difficult situation than in a public place or in a house with other people. Learning how to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre on yourself is probably your best strategy."

    There has been a sad decline in the overall gaming experience; and I feel this has been going on for years. I feel like the consumer keeps perpetuating this decline, and in part has some of the blame. I am calling out to others, we have to start doing something about this. 

      Quite frankly I don't care what we do. From not preordering games, boycotting, or even contacting lawmakers. I am desperate to stop this because I cant even trust a developer anymore, and I feel I have been burnt by even some of my favorite developers. There is no way, some of this stuff should be happening. 

      Even if nobody else cares or even if I get a million down-votes; I am going to pledge to be absolutely done with the lies, and decline of my FAVORITE pastime experience. I actually get anxiety thinking about it. I know I can't be the only one who feels this way.

      I understand being able to purchase what you want but, there is a shift happening with these gaming companies, and I just cant accept it anymore. I used to find preordering games years ago to be some of the best times in my life, but now.... I feel that its just blatant lying about certain products at this point. 

     Please, we have to come together as a gaming community, and start changing what is happening. 
From scam levels of micro transactions, to lies about products before they are released, we have to stop this.

For now all I can say and hope for is two things.

Pledge to not to preorder games anymore.

Avoid games and companies that have attempted to have unfair or expensive Micro Transactions.

ke5toz,LifeProTips,LPT: Teach money your kids early,"About 6 years ago the kids in our neighborhood had been doing lemonade stands every Summer. $1/cup. Pretty typical for around here.

Every weekend, a few kids would get together and set up out on the street corner. They would buy their own lemonade and plastic cups and make their own sign, etc. After all was said and done, every weekend they would profit about $25. And then split it began two or three kids.

About 6 years ago the oldest decided that wasn't enough. So she set up by herself. The first thing she did was cross out the $1 and wrote FREE. And then below that, she wrote “tips appreciated”. The first weekend, after 4 hours she came home with $180 in tips. By herself. She was out of lemonade. Her average take every weekend that Summer was $125. It turns out people don't ask for change when tipping and they often only have a $5 or $10 in their wallet. And they don't mind encouraging “a kid”.

I was floored. But it gets better. The next Summer, she wanted to beat her average. So she stopped keeping the money visible in a jar on the table. More people took pity on her that she wasn't making very much money. Although she never once lied about how much she was making, she let them make their assumptions based on only seeing a few dollars in there at a time. Her weekly average went up to $190. But that's nothing. She decided it was worth it to her to invest in more inventory and worth longer hours. I just sat back and watched the history and evolution of business develop before my eyes. By the end of the Summer she was working 8 hours every Saturday and bringing in about $350. For crappy lemonade. This is a 10 year old girl.

But it gets better. The next year, their son took over the lemonade stand. The daughter moved to another corner and started selling cookies…. That's a whole other story. The son really blew my mind. It occurred to him that he had a lot of traffic. So he talked to a couple of small business owners we go to church with. He convinced the owner of a disaster recovery company to “sponsor” the booth with advertising. So he put their logo on the booth for an extra $200/month for the three months of Summer. And he convinced another company to pay him an additional $200/month for the three months of Summer to set a stack of their flyers (custom designed by him) on the table.

This is still going on every Summer. The oldest is now almost 16 and too busy with college classes to do it anymore. The almost 14 year old son hired his younger sister this last Summer to run things FOR him and he pays her generously. He no longer has to work and pockets about $1000 every month during Summer for doing nothing. He now runs the cookie business as well. Every cup of lemonade gets a coupon for a cookie at half price. Half price for a cookie still quadruples his money just on the cookies.

And now he is considering adding hot chocolate and cookies in Winter. And the lemonade is still free…. But tips are appreciated. Haha!

I keep expecting him to start collecting email addresses and zip codes and to sign up for Square so he can accept credit cards, but he hasn't done that yet.

1. It must be a good movie by standards of quality, enjoyability, and general competence. Most Christian movies have little interest in being compelling films in their own right. A good movie must be able to stand on its own merits as a work of art.

2. The text of the film must be overtly Christian. Allegory and metaphor are gray areas, but the main themes and plot of the movie must be specifically focused on Christianity as a whole, or elements of Christianity.

3. The message of the film must be overall pro-Christianity, but it must also treat the opposing perspective with enough respect to be compelling. A good Christian movie posits both positive and negative aspects of Christianity, but ultimately finds itself in favor of Christianity."

Cyberpunk 2077 - CD Project Red - not even going to comment on this trash.
The Last Of Us Part 2 - Naughty Dogs - jesus!
FIFA - EA Sports - pure robbery!

Unfortunately all types of games that i on paper, would enjoy playing - but unfortunately get robbed by game companies and developers time and time again!

EA Sports (banned) - been playing fifa since the first titles - the unplayable trash they have put on the marked the last 10 years without fixing the issues many people have been complaining about for years - is a joke - + the feeling that you just buy an update at a full games price!

Ubisoft (banned) - all their open world games - feels like the same: boring stories, boring characters, predictable side missions, endless boring cutscenes etc. Repetitive gameplay and animations.
Watch Dogs Legion and AC Valhalla was the final final straw for me....one game could have been a mod of the other. With that comes a history of downgrading graphics for Watch Dogs 1 and Ghost Recon Wildlands - crap AC releases like Unity and Syndicate.

CD Project Red: when gamers makes games? I thought so - the Witcher 3 - was a brilliant game - released ONE MANY PLATFORMS - so i bought into the Cyberpunk hype - just to be f**ked by another game company! While not on my personal banned list yet - i have absolutely no faith or trust in them anymore - and will never pre-order any of their titles again.

Naughty Dogs: while TLOU2 from an technical and visual point of view was outstanding - the story was so thin written - that i really have a hard time understanding, why no one at  Naughty Dogs said: hey do you think people will like Joel to be murdered within the first 10 min of play? And spend most of the game playing as his murderess? Deluded faith in themselves and not their consumers - could be the explanation here. I don't trust Naughty Dogs - and it started with the last Uncharted - where I felt half the game was the ending and very very repetitive gameplay through that last half of the game.
Naughty Dogs was 2013's CD Project Red - ND messed up and lost a lot of trust from me and other gamers.

Who is left? To mainly deliver a good open worldish game?
The only one who haven't hugely disappointed me YET - are Rockstar Games - they might dwell on games with dlcs etc - but have no one's forcing you to get them? But ROCKSTAR GAMES better deliver on GTA6 or i think a lot of people will get fed up with the game industry! 

In general you should never pre-order, buy expansions or dlcs - to put the pressure on the game industry to deliver! Just think if a game had the expansions and dlcs from the start? Wouldn't it be the perfect game?
Would it be unfair to demand? That we actually get what we're paying for? 

The game industry are walking on some MIGHTY THIN ICE these years - of course if you're going to buy their games over and over - no matter if they stole your money in their previous title - then it won't change anything. We gamers need to put more pressure on game developers who keeps throwing trash at us and steal our money - for a project - that was showcased with trailers and demos that have nothing to do with the actual game released! Demo I believe, is a demonstration of a finished product - that you led to believe is not a alpha or a beta version? 

Stand up fellas - we need to boycott bad gaming companies if they're to listen to us!"

One time they went to an abandoned asylum and they try to summon a spirit in a industrial fridge. One of the three people was a girl and she had to cut her hand and spill blood on the door of the fridge but she was afraid to do it so her brother did it with his hand.
She performed the ritual ( sitting there in complete darkness and reading some text)
The door of the fridge got stuck and the other two could barely get her out of there, but the managers somehow
The spirit slowly starts to hunt every one of the group members with the help of the brother because his blood summoned it.
The movie ends with the creature tossing the brother in the fridge at the asylum and his long fingers grab his face from behind
It may be called the closet man but I couldn't find anything by that name
Also I think it was a police document or something"

ke6now,LifeProTips,LPT: Drone Engineering And Why Drones Are Important?," What Is Drone?

 Unmanned, weighs less than 20 kilograms, Any aircraft that emits less noise belongs to the drone category. The drone engineering system is designing from very light sources to increase Maneuvers at very high altitudes. It comprises components such as motors, batteries/fuel, propulsion, and covers (frame).

 The multi-propulsion system is a unique system of a drone. The uniqueness here is that even if one motor in the unit is idle, It has so many motors that it keeps flying. Drones use specialized, powerful batteries because which can fly in the air for a long time. Since drone technology is a complex engineering system, the noise emitted by the drone from the material used for that technology is also very low.

Drone engineering history

 Drone engineering technology was initially was using for military intelligence and special military services. In 1949, unmanned, helium, and hydrogen explosive balloons that struck Venice, Italy, became the first drone engineering technology model. During the Battle of New Chapel in 1915, the British used drone technology to obtain German forts’ images and maps. Later, America developed drone technology. In 1918, as a result, the United States created the Kettering Bug. At the same time, a man named Denny designed the remote-controlled OQ-2 drone.

Therefore, drone engineering technology has undergone a new revolution and is now base on various branches.

ke6tox,LifeProTips,"LPT: if you struggle to diet and stay healthy, try making small lifestyle changes that are easier to stick to. It will eventually become habit. Over time you can add to these and eventually you'll have the transformation you was trying to achieve with dieting.","An example of this could be to start having a glass of water with meals. This will ensure you are more hydrated and you'll be drinking water instead of soda or pop.

Or if you take public transport to work you can get off a stop earlier and get on a stop later. This will increase exercise without it feeling like it.

Another example could be to always have a piece of fruit as a mid morning snack. Not only is it nutritional but it will make you less hungry for lunch and will get you in the habit of eating fruit more.

I'm not saying to do these all at once. Just start with 1 and then add to it when it becomes habit. Making huge changes all at once is difficult to maintain and will always feel like a temporary measure until you've lost enough weight.

ke7ddi,gaming,We spent the last month building a more fun way to play games. Here's the result,"**TL:DR:**

* Web Platform that allows you to join games (currently only CSGO) in which you have to compete in fun team challenges
* Check it out to give feedback here: [https://challenges.gamebuddy.gg/](https://challenges.gamebuddy.gg/)
* The secret codeword is in the comments

Hey everyone,

have you ever felt the pain when playing competitive games just doesn't feel good sometimes? You're not on top of your game, get frustrated and to wrap it up your teammates are flaming your already tilted self. **Well, we certainly do** and wanted to have a way to still play competitively while having a fun experience.

That's why we came up with our own way to play the game by adding fun team challenges every second round. For every challenge the winning team gets 2 points, winning a CSGO round gives 1 point. In the end, the team with more total points wins. At first, we played the games with having one person observing and doing the referee for challenges but have now managed to check all challenges completely automatically by an algorithm.

We have come up with loads (*33 in total so far*) of different funny challenges, such as

* **Cuddle Challenge**: You're only allowed to move around being very close to all of your teammates
* **No Headshots**: You're not allowed to do a headshot.
* **Headshots only**: Killing without a headshot makes you lose the challenge
* **Best number is 73**: One teammate has to survive with EXACTLY 73 HP
* **Scout Showdown on A**: All players have to meet on A and wait until 01:20 before they are allowed to shoot. You may only use the Scout to do damage
* **Unscoped Sniper Kills only**: You're only allowed to kill others with unscoped sniper shots
* **Race to enemy spawn**: The team that has 1 teammate in the enemy spawn first, wins.
* **Run back to spawn after each kill**: You have to run back to your spawn after each kill. A multikill makes you lose the challenge.
* **Cheapest Kill**: Get a cheaper kill than the enemy team. The price of the killing weapon counts (Knife = 0$)
* **Knife Round**: You may only deal damage using the knife and nades
* **MVP 1v1 on A**: The two best players meet on A for a 1v1. The other teammates have to stay in spawn until the 1v1 is decided.
* **Shotguns only**: You may only deal damage using a shotgun, nades or knife.

Of course, we always try to add new challenges with feedback from all players.

Up until now we always played these matches with teams that we invited, either from the community or even with pros ([see the video to the event here](https://youtu.be/9RAKlgXH6Fg)). But now that we want to give everyone the opportunity to have more fun in CSGO and released a platform for everyone just yesterday.

Currently, the platform is in a very early alpha stage and will allow you to sign in for a match with challenges every day. Once the game starts, the platform shows you how to join it and will show all the challenges + results + standings.

In the future, however, the platform will have more than just that. Soon we will have

* A live matchmaking that queues you up to play instantly at any time you like
* A leaderboard giving you a way to become the best challenge player
* Exclusive events
* A way to qualify for the big events and play for big prize money
* and much more

We know that our platform state is very early, but want to hear everyone's feedback as early as possible to make it as good as possible for everyone and not just ourselves. Feel free to check out the site at [https://challenges.gamebuddy.gg/](https://challenges.gamebuddy.gg/), sign up for a match, and give us feedback on how you liked it. Currently, the platform is invite-only. The codeword to signup is **in the comments**.

If you made it this far reading we're excited to hear what you think. If you have any challenge ideas you'd like to play feel also free to post those.

The next chosen person is some guy who is more or less a Salvation Army volunteer working at a mall. Meanwhile, there's a black guy who happens to be an amateur thief at this same mall. Just as Santa was about to pass his gift, the thief collides into the crowd, and Santa passes the gift to him.

So yeah, it's a black Santa story, and I remember it being pretty wholesome. But I haven't seen it in over a decade, so any help would be appreciated."

I am trying to limit the amount of games on the Internal SSD as space is not a luxury so I have a 2TB external HDD to account for it and so can swap games in and out.

However, I have some games that when I try and launch from the HDD are saying it needs an upgrade and then downloads the entire game again on the Internal. So my question really is, is there a way to stop it using the Series S version and just play it from the old HDD as a normal Xbox One game or if there is an upgrade I am forced to install it on the Internal to play it?

Second, why is it downloading the game again if it is on the HDD. I feel like there are two versions, is it possible to move the upgraded too and from if I have to use the upgraded.

Old non upgraded games play fine from the HDD and so it is slightly annoying it's forcing me to play an upgraded version of a game I'm not too fussed about being upgraded for the sake of keeping it on the external. Is there a way around this.

Games that force me are Rogue Company and No Mans Sky.
MCC collection is on the HDD but launches from the HDD. It doesnt ask for the upgraded version or to be moved to the internal. I thought this would be the case for all games but I am willing to learn how it all works and why some games wont run from external etc.

Anyway, let me know what's the deal if possible as I am... confused.com"

Also, there aren't really any new games interesting me right now, as I'm not into Assassin's Creed or Watch Dogs and I don't need a new Call of Duty every year. Couple this with the fact that the year's most anticipated game turned out to be a piece of garbage, I decided to hold off on buying new games for a while.

I decided at first to try PS Now on my PS4. It only works when it wants to, sometimes it'll just say my internet is too shitty for it to work for no reason. Plus the game selection is balls IMO.

So I decided to go with option B, and dive into retro gaming. I use a website called Vimm's Lair to download ROMs and ISOs, and play these games via emulators on a PC using a PS4 controller. With this I can have access to the entire game libraries of the NES, SNES, N64, GameCube, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Sega Genesis, PS1, and PS2, all for free.

So until there is an abundance of cool new games to play, and the retail stock problem of the PS5 and Xbox Series X is fixed, I will be sticking with retro games for a while."

ke95wv,linux,How to use your phone as a speaker in Linux,"First off, you will need a phone obviously. Mine runs iOS, but Android should work... I think...? Not sure if Android has a firewall enabled. For me, on iOS, I didn't have to mess with any firewalls.

You'll need Pulseaudio on your Linux machine, and you'll need to have ""module-rtp-send"" enabled. For Arch users, to do that just install pulseaudio-rtp.

Okay with that out of the way, **the instructions:**

**Firstly, create a null sink with the name ""rtp"" or whatever:**

    pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=rtp
    
    # Optional - this sets the description for the null sinks
    pacmd 'update-source-proplist rtp.monitor device.description=""Monitor of RTP""'
    pacmd 'update-sink-proplist rtp device.description=""RTP""'

The last two lines just change the name of the null sinks as displayed in pavucontrol. I didn't like seeing ""Null Sink"" and ""Monitor of Null Sink"", as that causes confusion with more complicated setups.

Now you **setup module-rtp-send**, and this time you need the IP address of your phone. For me that's [192.168.100.18](https://192.168.100.18). Obviously you need to have the phone and Linux machine on the same network. Choose an arbitrary port number - I choose 1234:

    pactl load-module module-rtp-send source=rtp.monitor destination_ip=192.168.100.18 port=1234

Note how I used ""rtp.monitor"" as the source. This is because that's the name of the thing, as we used ""sink\_name=rtp"" while creating it. Also note that this ""rtp"" name, and the ""RTP"" description I set earlier are different things.

Now you just redirect any audio you wanna play into the RTP sink. To do that, just open pavucontrol, go to the Playback tab, and change the playback device for the application you want to ""RTP"" (or ""Null Sink"" if you didn't rename it like I did).

**Playing the sound in your phone:**

Open VLC (the mobile app), open the Network tab, click ""Open Network Stream"" and enter ""rtp://@:1234"" (change the port number if you didn't use 1234 in the previous steps). Now you should be able to hear whatever's playing. You can use headphones too.

What's actually happening here is that the Linux machine is sending UDP packets to the IP address specified earlier and the port. UDP is different from TCP - it doesn't have to succeed. This is why you can keep the RTP stream going in the Linux machine, and open and close VLC whenever you want. When you open VLC, it will start listening for UDP packets and pick them up (and play them). This relies on the RTP protocol which uses UDP.

I had to do this because my laptop's headphones are shit, and I do have Apple headphones but it's lightning. But now I can do this to listen to Spotify or whatever on my phone, and the quality is impressive. I did notice a 0.5 to 1 second lag though. But since my use case is songs, that's fine."

I am making a video about character creation in games and I was wondering if you can share what is important in that aspect of games for you.   


If you can respond to few of my questions, to help me see what gamers really want, I would be very grateful.  


1. What is the most important thing in character creation menu in games you play for you?
2. Do you make a character based on yourself or do you make a made-up character and roleplay their story?
3. Is it important for you to be able to pick a gender for your character?
4. What part of character creation you enjoy the most (shaping of the body and face, picking stats, choosing a name?)
5. Can you share an image of one of your characters (and consent that i can use your image in my video) and explain your thought process while making that character?
6. What would you say to developers that would improve character creation menu?  


This is somewhat related to the whole thing with Cyberpunk, but the video will not be about that exactly, just gave me the idea to try to research what people expect.  


You don't have to answer all my questions, but I would be thankful if you can share your opinion.

keaao1,gaming,Bizarre multi-year problem patching NBA 2K,"I bought three different iterations: NBA 2k17, 2k18, and 2K20. Each version has been installed on at least two different laptops, using different internet networks, and I even created a different Steam account for 2K20 in case my Steam account was the issue. I have changed all the possible factors I could change, but I always get the same bizarre problem. 

Critical folders do not patch, specifically the folders related to saving the game. I have the capacity to make saves for maybe 20 hours of gameplay, and then the capacity gradually whittles away until I can no longer save anything. Saving is really important to this game, especially how I play.

I have been over this with 2K support of the game many times and they cannot figure out why these folders do not patch. I follow all of the instructions they give me and the folders will not install. I have talked with other players of the game, and none of them have ever had this problem or even heard of this problem. Nobody can explain to me why I can't get these folders installed. The only thing remaining would be that I always have the same program installed on every single computer -- even computers that are brand-new and the game is one of the first things I put on the computer -- and that this program is somehow interfering with the installation, some bizarre program that none of the hundreds of thousands of other players have installed.

Can anyone suggest to me what could possibly be causing this and what could resolve the problem? I can't speak with the game's support unless I buy the new version of the game, and I'm not about to possibly lose all that money yet again, especially since they always tell me the same stuff that doesn't work."

The big part of this is to be kind to others in general.  However, in those small moments of the day that likely become routine after a while, be kind than too and you will be surprised the effect it can have.

Going through the Drive Through for your morning coffee/breakfast? Ask the person on the intercom how they are doing and how their day is going.  You would be surprised how often those people don't get any positive interaction from customers, and most will be caught off guard.  That one small positive interaction you provided could change their entire day.    

That is just one example of a much larger scenario, but you get it. 

If you stop for a minute, and in your day to day hustle and bustle, think about the interactions you have with people, think about whether these people likely have good ones or bad ones, you could BE that good one for them.

I get that bugs are hard to predict and they take time to fix, so can games just be advertised without the date/threat of forcing a release before a game is ready? There are tons of ways that games are advertised that can still be released without a specific date. They are literally just guessing and hoping it works out when the game isn't really done and they give a release date anyway. They can start advertising dates when the game is actually finished to the point where they don't have to issue refunds almost immediately. Gamers should not have worry about getting a refund for a game that has been promised as finished and spectacular after waiting for years and delayed again multiple times.

Genuinely it just seems selfish to me and I do not understand why the gaming industry is allowed to advertise dates that they don't stick to and release things that are not finished."

That just means that you look to the environment around you and say, ""You know, that reminds me of..."" and then fill in the blank. It's great for opening new conversational threads and it can also work as a follow-up when someone finishes telling a story which is how many groups of friends interact all the time. 

&#x200B;

That's because people are drawn to others who they feel are similar to themselves and related stories can build that bridge — just be sure NOT to repeatedly make your story superior to theirs or else you can feel like one-upping.

keb256,gaming,A New Star Wars Game," The games that are currently out with star wars are all very cool, but are limited. I think it would be AWESOME to see an open world star wars game. Almost like a star wars version of GTAV. You would be able to travel to the different planets, complete missions for different groups in the galaxy for items or money. You could design your own character becoming a bounty hunter, a Mandalorian, Jedi, etc. You could have your own ship where you store your items and works as not only a travel system but a place for you to relax and use different interaction menus. Also a clan system would be neat, you could get a capital for your clan and do a variety of new things, maybe go against another clan in a skirmish. Be able to get speeders, just have an open world game. It's something that seems so obvious to make but never has and probably never will. Just an idea. :/"

But consider this: many people consider games like You Don't Know Jack, Smash Bros, Sing Star, Rock Band, Mario Kart and Mario Party to be ""party games"".

*However there's a key issue:* Outside of accommodating large amounts of players, usually between 4 to 8.... **those games I listed share very little in common as far as mechanics are concerned**. Being approachable to new players is often the case, but that hardly qualifies as a unique property since **virtually every genre has games with a focus on being approachable** in order to attract more players. Even games like Street Fighter or Guilty Gear have often had developers in interviews that they feel they made their games too difficult to attract people who weren't already fans of the genre or series, and wanted to take steps to remedy that (3 frame buffering, input leniency, one mechanic having multiple functions, etc).

Of course most people use ""Party Game"" to dismiss something as ""not a real x game"" in a genre (the classic debate of **whether or not** **Smash Bros qualifies as a fighting game** has raged for *over two decades).* And that's just the silly, petty elitism that people make fun of gamers for.

kede2t,gaming,Too many video games forget they are games.,"Something that I think older developers had a greater grasp on was that video games are, at their core, games.

*Well what does that mean?*

If you do a quick Google search, the definition of ""game"" is "" An activity providing entertainment or amusement; a pastime."" By this definition, what I'm saying doesn't make any sense.

The definition of game I mean, in particular, is this one: ""a physical or mental competition conducted according to rules with the participants in direct opposition to each other.""

I want to clarify that not all video games are traditional competitions. This is self-evident. Almost all video games, though, feature some kind of competitive aspect, whether that be PvP, PvE, or otherwise.

To provide a visual, think of *Call of Duty.* I think that one of the biggest flaws of these games is that the campaign is meant to be *experienced*, not *played*. You can get an equal experience watching TheRadBrad play the COD campaigns as you can playing it. I think the campaigns have some good moments in terms of gameplay, but more often than not, there is almost no incentive to replay the campaigns beyond the narrative.

Not to discredit the narrative, but it shouldn't be prioritized over gameplay. If you wanted to tell that story, cinema is a better medium.

Gameplay is vital, this is well-known. We don't get excited over cinematic trailers anymore. We aren't as easily duped into believing that a narrative can save a game.

An element of gameplay that doesn't receive as much attention as it should is helping the player learn the mechanics. I would argue that players don't just ""learn"" mechanics; they ""solve"" them. Mechanics are puzzle pieces that are used to solve problems through a game. A game like *Minecraft* has a lot of ""puzzle"" mechanics. Crafting is literally a puzzle (at least it was). So what's my point?

Games are fundamentally about problem solving, as far as I can tell. Games that are subpar tend to share some characteristics. The biggest mistake one can make in terms of gameplay is making the system counterintuitive to solving problems within the game, especially in the name of realism. For example, if your game involves fighting across a linear battlefield with long sight lines, but the tactics needed to flush opponents out of cover, grenades), can only be thrown a short distance, then the game quickly becomes frustrating, because there is little one can do to progress. Making problems like this more frustrating to solve makes games unenjoyable.

The example of this kind of mechanic is something that occurred in older versions of *Minecraft*. When drowning, your first instinct is to swim up. However, taking damage used to slow down or knock the player back enough that oftentimes players would be quasi-stunlocked underwater, forced to drown. There was no way to counteract this. While it teaches players to be conscious of their breath, it also disincentivizes going underwater, hence the changes to *Minecraft*'s gameplay come the Ocean update.

I'm not sure how to word this any further, but games have had an identity crisis as of the last decade. Although games like *Doom: Eternal, COD: Black Ops Cold War,* and *Cyberpunk 2077* have largely avoided this, over the past ten years most games trashed the original conventions of their predecessors in favor of more cinematic elements; these elements almost always coming at the expense of gameplay. I'm happy to see the return of more puzzle-like elements, damage indicators, and platforming in modern games. Nintendo didn't fall into this trap, for the most part. Almost all Nintendo games are hyperaware of what they are, a video game. I'm not a Nintendo guy, but I can't help but respect Nintendo for their commitment to video games (not community tho lol). I'm glad to see *Doom: Eternal* and *Titanfall 2* be praised so much for their gameplay, and almost all of it is because both of them have such great understanding of what they are. Valve also has a great understanding of this. Unfortunately, many Triple A games have struggled with this, although I sense a change.

As a final remark, seeing the hatred for *Halo: Infinite*'s gameplay reveal was disheartening. Ultimately, I liked the reveal, not because the game looked graphically polished, it wasn't, but because the game looks *fun* because it seems to have embraced the parts of *Halo*'s gameplay that embraced its video game status. Especially the expansion of the sandbox for more ways to solve problems in the game. I'm very excited because I believe *Infinite* will be a great game, even if people discard it for petty reasons.

Also, please make better tutorials, game developers. I have ADHD, reading blocks of instructions do not teach me how the mechanics of your game are used. Thanks."

kedqry,gaming,Can anyone suggest a good First Person Shooter with the ability to choose a server?,"I used to play the older Call of Duty quite a bit, and there was a very active community of players on a particular server, where we liked to talk to each other, either via the mike or the text chat feature. Sadly, I've yet to experience something like that again in more recent times. 

I think the problem is the auto-match-making function present in most games today. It seems that most games pick a server for you based on skill level and ping. That functionality does have a reason to exist and I'm not saying games shouldn't do that at all, but it also means you can't frequent a server that generally has friendly people on it, a server that has more strict rules against bullying or spawn camping, or one that is more technically reliable. 

More often than not I end up on a server where literally not even one person uses the text chat or the mike. Even when I do, in Call of Duty Modern Warfare (2019) I get about 30 seconds after the game to talk to people before it may very well end up scattering us. Not much ""calm time"" to talk without the heat of a battle to get in our way.

Anyone know of a PC game that does allow players to pick a server manually by name from a list? It's okay if the game also has the option to automatically find a server for you. If there's a game that does this I'll check out the reviews and gameplay videos to see if I should get it."

kedw3g,LifeProTips,LPT: Modern automobiles DO NOT need to be warmed up before driving in cold weather.,"I've tried to explain this to people in my life, to no avail. So hopefully, I can at least help some of you out. 

There's a long lasting belief that, in cold weather, your vehicle need to idle a bit before driving, in order for the oil to heat properly. Modern synthetic oil is designed to work in cold and warm temperatures. (Just make sure you are using the correct oil for your car.)

This myth does have some truth. Before the early 80's, most cars/trucks had carburetors, which DID need to warm a bit to work properly. However, the car makers did away with carburetors in favor of electronic fuel injection which uses sensors to supply fuel to the engine and get the right air and fuel mix**.** That eliminated the need to warm the vehicle, because the sensors monitor and adjust to temperature conditions. 

This does NOT apply to people that like to warm it up to dethaw frost or ice, make wiping snow off easier, or just so it's warm when you get in. (Idling is still not good for the environment, no matter the reason.)"

keecle,LifeProTips,LPT: Use built in apps/low power devices instead of video game consoles when streaming videos to save energy costs,"An average video game console uses 90 watts and up to 180 watts; if your TV has built in streaming apps or you have a roku/firestick the energy draw is significantly less. (Firestick pulls ~2 watts; TV is a sunk cost because you're already running it to watch the show). Assuming an average of 4 hours per day at 90 watts (some less/some more) at 10 cents per kWh the yearly cost would be an additional cost of $13.14. Estimating the same 4 hours per day at 2 watts at 10 cents the yearly cost would only be .29 cents; a $12.85 difference. This will change depending on your energy costs/usage.. obviously not a huge chunk of change but if you're looking at every penny it'll help you save especially if you energy usage and/or costs are higher.

keecrp,gaming,"The “open beta” release model works better than the alternative, but more transparency is needed.","Every time there is a major release, we get a parade of angry gamers upset that the game isn’t polished or complete. For some games, this is more relevant than others, but there has not been a single major release over the past few years that I would consider without obvious major flaws. 

This is a good thing though. Bugs can be identified and patched way quicker than if the entire studio just played the game over and over again to find random bugs. It gives players an opportunity to give feedback on potential features they’d like. 

The problem, to me, is that marketing makes us believe we’ll get the end product on day one, and we keep falling for it. We should embrace the “open beta” formula and ask for more influence over features based on player feedback. I would like a system that summarily read: we’ll find the bugs, so use the saved time to give us some features that we think up. 

Launch day could be the start of the open beta with formal release 6 months later. The games are too complex and big. The devs need us, they really do, and this is a way to give players more content and better overall games while also satisfying the investors. It’s a win win for everyone. Better games.

keedgb,xboxone,Question about saves in Mass Effect and Xbox Game Pass.,"Hello people, 

So here's the rundown: Currently, I'm subscribed to Xbox Game Pass because I used it to play Jedi Fallen Order as well as a few other games. I'm now looking at the Mass Effect trilogy on Game Pass because I never played ME 2 or 3, but the thing is, a friend is also giving me his collection of all three ME games for Christmas because he won't ever play them again. I'll be honest, I'm kind of done with Game Pass and Mass Effect was the only reason I was gonna stay subscribed, but since I'm getting the games for free, why should I? 

But here's the rub: I'm bored as hell and absolutely ITCHING to play Mass Effect. Like yesterday. I don't think I can wait until Christmas to begin my galactic journey. So here's my question: if I start a save on the Game Pass version of Mass Effect and then later unsubscribe from the service and use my own disk for the game, will my data carry over and I can just pick up where I left off? Or will unsubscribing from Game Pass delete my save? In other words: how are my saves stored with Game Pass? Are they somehow saved with the subscription or on my Xbox? 

Side question: you use saves from Mass Effect 1 to decide things about Mass Effect 2 and onwards. Choices you make in the first game are carried over to the later ones. How would that work with Game Pass? If I played ME 1 entirely on Game Pass but then picked up the disk for ME 2, would my choices carry over?"

Pros- richly immersive city, fantastic set design in general, fun to explore, interesting, unusual and beautiful even in its ugliness to behold.  Really appreciating the design of this vast playground, with partially destructible environments, fast travel options, lots of interiors to explore as well, and significant verticality in design, as in being able to jump around on rooftops a bit. 

Minor Downside- parkour and city exploration of a sort has been done and well in other games, and while CP is decent, it falls short in the extremity of it.  Ie- no Dying Light parkour.  No Assassins Creed climbing.  No Spider-Man type of travel.   Night City is fairly well realized, but it can be a bit of a chore to navigate.  

Pros- lots of customization options, including character appearance, life paths, choices in convos leading to multiple endings.   Also, quite a few options for vehicles, weapons, clothing, cyberware.  Have to acknowledge the work that went into this level of detail in window dressing, immersion & role playing.  

Cons- people will never be satisfied until you give them all the tools to create what they like in a way which feels natural to them.    Clothing and weapon options always seemed like I was just making do with the best stuff I could find lying about.

I also put a lot of points into tech to create legendary items, and the crafting felt like a chore.   I haven’t explored probably a lot of this game, which encourages multiple playthroughs, but it wasn’t clear to me how to get enough money for what I wanted, how to level my character and tweak their performance to my liking, and crafting should be optimized as well (like a button to make 50 of something, particularly upgrading components). 

The gameplay loop felt a little anemic after a while too, as it has for me in other massive AAA games like RDR2.   The story is what keeps people going. The gameplay loop otherwise is just stealing and killing, and driving cars. 

The problem with the beautifully acted, scripted and voiced NPCS, which possess an admirable aesthetic and level of detail, is that talking to them is very time consuming.  The whole thing, including travel time and unskippable cut scenes is almost like being inside a first person choose your own adventure movie where all you do is shoot, hack, drive, fight, and play with virtual dolls.  

So, for me, the game looks and sounds great, but is a bit clunky in some regards.  Definitely worth playing- but i will have to see if the replay value is as high as it’s made out to be.   

Every article I’ve been seeing is whining about the bugginess, the marketing strategy, the ‘shallowness’ and what they personally find offensive about the game.  I do not think for a second that a game company should try to publish something catering to SJWs, but I do think more time and money could have been better spent in customization, depth, fun factor and thorough play testing.   

4/5 stars or 9.1/10 from me."

https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/cto/d/mountain-view-jet-powered-volkswagen/7241823593.html

The engine is a General Electric Model T58-8F with some internal modifications and a custom tailpipe. The 300lb. engine spins up to 26,000 RPM (idle is 13,000 RPM), draws air at 11,000 CFM, and is rated at 1350 hp. The structure holding the engine was designed using finite element analysis and is redundant. Strong, damage tolerant, and light. The force from the jet is harnessed using sandwich plates bolted to contoured aluminum billets inserted into the frame rails. The engine has rigid mounts with rubber bushings in the front and the back are sliding. It grows as it warms up so the engine mounts have to account for this. The interior was finished in the original color with two-stage PPG paint. A heat blanket keeps the plastic bumper from melting when the jet is operating."

keemqs,cyberpunkgame,PSA: Don't disassemble any iconic/legendary items!,"Iconic and legendary items can be upgraded to higher tiers later on once you have the necessary crafting perks, but only if you have the lower tier variant. Once you disassemble the weapon, there is no way (that I know of) to get it back, meaning you will not be able to make the better version of it. This was something I did not realize earlier, so I wanted to let people know so they don't make the same mistake I did."
keemqh,cyberpunkgame,"The ""Stronger Together"" and ""Transporter"" Perks Should Also Apply to Grappled Enemies","Title.

As it is now, ""grappling"" and related skills/perks are oddly implemented; while Stronger Together and Transporter by themselves seem to encourage the rather odd playstyle of lugging around a dead/unconscious friend since there is rarely an organic reason for your to be carrying a body and needing to shoot someone.

First we have the Body attribute which reduces your movement penalty while grappling an enemy, increases your movement speed while grappling an enemy, and increases how long you can grapple an enemy. All of those buffs seem rather pointless when you have little to no reason to pull an enemy around instead of just finishing them off and moving their body.

The ""Human Shield"" perk in Athletics gives you additional armor while grappling an enemy, but again, why? You have zero reason to lumber around with a grappled enemy, especially in the middle of combat.

""Stunning Blows"" in the Stealth tree gives you the opportunity to stun an enemy, letting you grapple them, when you quick melee with a gun. While this has the application of letting you use a takedown on an enemy mid-combat, it begs the question of why didn't you just shoot them or use an actual melee weapon? Both of those options would likely kill them just as fast and not lock you into animations. It would also *seem* like this was meant to be paired with Human Shield to quickly grab an enemy mid combat for protection, but doing so leaves you with no offensive options and your only defense being to awkwardly try to shuffle behind cover.

Changing Transporter(fire pistols/revolvers while carrying a body) and Stronger Together(Increase damage while carrying a body) to also work while grappling an enemy would improve all of the above skills. With that change, you could then enter combat, use Stunning Blow to stun an enemy close to you, grab them, gain a bonus to your armor and damage thanks to Human Shield and Stronger Together, start shooting with Transporter, and with your investment into Body have improved speed and a decent amount of time before your shield buddy breaks free or you need to finish them off."

keepjs,cyberpunkgame,I think I might have discovered how a translation mistake may have caused much of the recent refund controversies ...,"The Polish version of the ""apology"" (which, I presume, was the initial one) says that you can ""apply for a refund"". Applying for something implies that you can be refused. Choose to apply for a refund and be either denied or approved. 

The English version, the one that most of people will see states that you can ""opt to refund your copy"". To opt... implies that it is an available choice, like it's guaranteed. Choose to get a refund, or not.

First I thought that they were being maliciously deceptive again... now I think that they're being stupid and made a silly mistake while translating their ""apology"", which led millions of people to believe they would be granted refunds upon request.

By the way, how naïve are people defending them ? Saying that they're cool after all because they apologized ? What else could they have done ? It's a PR play, the only one that makes sense at this point. It is damage control, to keep as much money as they can. It is not motivated by a need to regain their reputation (good luck with that), it is motivated by money, as was the initial attempt at pulling off the biggest scam in gaming history.

keephk,cyberpunkgame,Item transmogrification station or vendor to transform item appearance.,"I know pitching an improvement idea is a bit hopeful know there is much to be altered and  expanded on in coming updates. 

But here goes!.

Item transmogrification. I posted before about the lootable clothing items not being quite that good.

There are some i really like, like the half face gas mask and samurai style paramilitary helmet combo. And yes i can grind and keep upgrading this specific piece. But i will and do find better alternatives stat wise and roll wise. 

The problem is some of those items are just not appealing in the looks department. 

I would love to ""eventually"" see a system official, or modded. That when you loot an item of clothing the design, style of the item becomes available at a transmog station for a cost. 

If you could use crafting components to pay to re-roll certain stats that would also be cool. But its maintaining a style of character that i am most interested in personally. 

When i loot a part of awesome combat trousers, i really don't wanna move to that pair of short shorts because it somehow gives me a massive boost to armour. 

Something akin to the Diablo transmog station. 

I will absolutely grind the components to keep upgrading my equipment i like. But having the option to pay in some form of ingame credits or credits/crafting components to transform the item appearance would go a long way to investing me further in creating the Cyberpunk i want to be. 

I don't know if people will agree with this or not. 

But that string top and short shorts combo is doing nothing for my characters intimidation factor haha."

kefccb,gaming,What should our expectations for games be?,"I recently found myself in a debate with someone over what our expectations for game studios should be and how their output should affect those expectations. IMO we should always have high expectations for a game regardless of how precious games by the same studio have been. Take CDPR, we had high expectations for CP2077 because of The Witcher 3 but the developers/studio have obviously failed to deliver to the level that the bar we set was at. This of course will lead to many people having low expectations for CDPR’s next game whatever that may be however I don’t think that is the correct way to go about doing things, if we have low expectations for a game that means the bar is low and developers only have to deliver a game made to a low standard, this means that if they exceed the low standard, reviewers and gamers alike will be impressed by what could by all means be little more than a mediocre game. In this way we reward game studios by having low expectations for their games and in my opinion the last thing that we should do is reward game studios for putting out bad games. 

NB: I should clear up that I understand that developers probably want to make a game to the best of their ability regardless of the expectations for the game that they are making, however when I say studios I mean the guys at the corporate level who see the games as little more than monetary gain and don’t care about the art in the games."

kefgjc,LifeProTips,"LPT - Winter is coming. Don’t cheap out on anything that comes between you and the ground, like shoes, socks, car tires, carpet, a chair, or a mattress. You will absolutely live to regret it.","Story time! 

When I first started my career in nursing, I didn’t buy the best shoes like I should have, because I was being cheap even though I didn’t need to be. Fast forward a few months, and I had plantar fasciitis so bad that I needed surgery. Cost me months of my career. 

I learned my lesson the hard way so you all don’t have to. Be nice to yourself if something touches the ground. You can *easily* injure yourself over time otherwise. Sleep problems? It’s probably your mattress. Buy something better and be nice to your spine. Foot problems? Go see an orthopedist and get a shoe prescription; a lot of health insurance covers it these days. Tail bone hurt when you sit? It’s probably your chair. Get something better. 

And for the love of all things, with winter here make sure your tires aren’t ass and check to see if you live near any free air spots. In my part of the country we have a convenience store called Wawa; the gas station versions all have free air. Get some good tires and keep them at 32+ psi. It could legitimately save your life in crappy weather, and we’re getting a lot of it this year. Some of the wild animals near me all started growing their winter coats months early, which typically means a *bad* winter. Don’t go driving in that garbage with bad tires.

What are your thoughts on it overall?

I think it sucks. Unlike most I disliked it from the beginning (not starting with TLJ or TROS). TFA was such a cheap nostalgia bait movie. Its basically guaranteed the other two movies wouldn't be good.

It basically reset the galaxy to how it was at the beginning of A New Hope. Instead of moving forward we just have new versions of Rebels vs the Empire + a ""bigger"" Death Star with Starkiller Base. Everything the OT heroes did, didn't matter.

TLJ continued this but then added some twists for the sake of it and didn't set up the next movie (killing off Snoke for an example). Luke was portrayed horribly, no surprise Mark Hamill called him ""Jake"" Skywalker.

TROS is probably the worst. When I first heard Palpatine was back I thought people were joking, it felt like bad fanfiction straight out of some poorly received Legends Book.

The characters of the ST were all weak. Finn is so wasted even his actor is pissed. Rey is just bland, feels like she is just there to redo Luke's story but she doesn't stand on her own..its clear they didn't even know her origins. Kylo Ren is probably the most fleshed out one but still felt rehashed with his redemption.

The rest of the new characters suck."

keg0w6,movies,"Enough is enough, Die Hard Is Not a Christmas Movie!!!","I never wanted to write this essay. This debate has come up every year recently, and I hate it because it is just a cacophony of wrongness that drives me bananas. I wasn’t going to weigh in on it officially, but I realized it would be efficient to have all my reasoning compiled in a single location so that in the future I can save time by just pointing people to this article and thereby not have to discuss it any further. Is *Die Hard* a Christmas movie? 

**No, it is not.**

Let’s start by acknowledging that there are two ways to become a Christmas movie—and *Die Hard* does probably qualify under one of them. The two ways use different, non-overlapping evidence. That first way is by tradition and association. 

Anything can become a Christmas movie if it’s by tradition. *Predator* could be a Christmas movie if it became a tradition to watch it during the season. It is arguable that enough people have made it a holiday tradition to watch the movie this time of year that *Die Hard* is a Christmas movie by this method. Evidence such as seeing the DVD on sale at Target in the “Xmas movies” section, or the movie playing during a TNT “Christmas movie marathon,” would fall here, because becoming a movie this way says nothing about the actual movie itself, only about people’s perceptions of it. Many people may associate *Die Hard* with Christmas, but that does not make it a Christmas movie.

If *Predator* came to be popularly associated with Christmas, it would also be sold by Target and played by TNT in the same way, because companies are just looking to market to people, ride trends, and make as much money as possible. If companies hear a movie is being associated with a holiday by any meaningful metric, they will sell it next to that holiday. It says nothing about the movie itself. 

This brings up the inherent unfairness of the association factor, which is that just by engaging in this conversation, opponents of the *Die Hard* theory—like me—reinforce the connection because we keep putting “*Die Hard”* and “Christmas” next to each other in sentences. The more I argue about this, the longer this argument goes on, the more I lose because it just builds the status of the other side.

I reject this method of being a Christmas movie, however, because this isn’t what the “yeses” truly mean when they say *Die Hard* is a Christmas movie. The true controversy is over the second way to be a Christmas film: **it's content**. 

Only the content of the film actually matters in this discussion; it is the only truly relevant evidence. In saying that, I will take a digression to dispense with another form of evidence: artist intent. I subscribe, more or less, to the “death of the author*”* theory: An artist’s intention when making a work of art can be taken as informative, but it is not dispositive. Once a piece is out in the world, it stands on its own.

Even taking the artist's intent into account, what do we have? Much has been made of the fact that the writer of *Die Hard*, Steven E. de Souza, has gone on record to say he believes it *is* a Christmas movie. The thing about that is though: he’s just the writer. Movies are collaborative projects that require the input of dozens, if not hundreds, of people to come to life, and some input matters more than others. Within that hierarchy, the writer ranks very low. The joke is that the blonde goes to Hollywood and sleeps with the writer. It’s also a truism that film is fundamentally a director’s medium (whereas theater best showcases actors and television writers). All which is to say, of all the possible people to have on your side in this debate, you come at me backed up by the *writer*? 

Ultimately, of course, it wouldn’t matter if the writer, director, stars, and craft services all released a public statement formally declaring *Die Hard* a Christmas film because the intent of the artist is not dispositive; it is merely informative. The only conclusive evidence lies within the four corners of the work of art. All that matters is the movie itself.

*Die Hard* is an action movie, with Christmas elements sprinkled in. None of these Christmas elements are essential to the film. Every one of them could be removed, or replaced, and the movie would still work. Not only would it still work, but it would also be nearly unchanged. 

Compare *Die Hard* to an actual Christmas movie: *The Santa Clause*. In *The Santa Clause*, the entire film, nearly every scene, relies on Christmas or something Christmas-related as a premise. In *Die Hard*, what is there? A handful of jokes. A couple of songs. The biggest element is the fact that the attack takes place during an office Christmas party, but this could be replaced with anything. It could be a New Year’s party, a Super Bowl party, a party celebrating a merger, the Christmas part is irrelevant. It’s a setting; not a genre. 

*Die Hard* could take place during the company’s non-denominational office holiday party. It doesn’t have to be Christmas; it would still work fine. But apply that same logic to *Elf*, and the movie doesn’t work. That’s why *Elf* is a Christmas movie, and *Die Hard* isn’t.

*Die Hard* is not a Christmas movie because it’s not about Christmas; it just takes place during it. It’s more like *The Karate Kid*. There is a scene in *The Karate Kid* that takes place over Halloween. Would you call *The Karate Kid* a Halloween movie? 

Here’s a thought experiment. Imagine an alien came to Earth and said, “teach me what a Christmas movie is.” Would you show the alien *Die Hard*? After seeing only *Die Hard*, would the alien be able to turn around and produce a Christmas movie? If you told the alien all the hallmarks of a Christmas movie and then showed it *Die Hard*, would the alien be confused? 

One weak-as-hell argument I’ve heard is that *Die Hard* has “Christmas themes.” Namely, over the course of the film, John McClane rekindles his relationship with his estranged wife, Holly. This isn’t a Christmas theme. It’s an action movie theme. Action and adventure movies constantly feature the reunion of estranged people and families. It’s a trope. Think of *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. Think of *Terminator 2*. *Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade*. *The River Wild*. *The Incredibles*, *Indiana Jones and The Crystal Skull*, *True Lies*. And saving a relationship is just a mild spin on forming a relationship, which adds a whole new crop of action movies to list, not least of which being “Die Hard on a bus,” *Speed*. Even in the *Die Hard* series, John McClane reunites with every other estranged member of his family, in sequels that don’t take place on Christmas.

When all is said and done, it comes down to an analogy. Imagine the movie is a Jenga tower. If you pull out all the Christmas stuff, does it remain standing? Take all the Christmas out of *Miracle on 34th Street* and it would topple. Pull the Christmas from *Jingle All The Way*, it falls. If you take the Christmas out of *Die Hard*, it would remain standing. The reason is because it is not a Christmas movie. It’s an action movie with some Christmas seasoning. The Christmas stuff, it’s just gravy. The action is the meal. 

*Die Hard* is an action movie with some Christmas tinsel on it. But a little bit of tinsel does not make you a Christmas tree.

Get over it.

Happy Holidays."

I’ve checked the error codes and some other threads that suggest a database rebuild or continuously uninstalling and reinstalling games (potato internet makes this unsustainable).

kegfac,movies,The fassbender Steve Jobs movie is crazy overlooked,"The fassbender Steve Jobs movie is crazy underrated

I watched it a few years ago shortly after it came out on VOD, loved it then. Thought it was worth all the acclaim it got. 

Turned it on Netflix last night, and I don’t know why but something about it clicked even more and I absolutely loved it even more.

The acting (not a single bad performance in the whole cast), the fast paced direction by Boyle, the unique structure of the script by Sorkin. Sure, it goes hard into the walking and talking style that he’s become known for, but goddamn does it work here! Felt like I was watching a great play (and I’m not a theater guy by any means)! Even the small details like how each of the three time periods look and feel are fantastic.

The real gem is fassbender though. Even though people who knew jobs in real life says he wasn’t that much of an asshole, fassbender still nailed the core of him. He’s just so good in the movie. 

Do yourself a favor and watch it!"

kegmkm,LifeProTips,LPT: Three questions to ask a counselor or psychologist before allowing them to treat you,"I posted this in a subreddit for women with ADHD and it was suggested I post it here too.

I majored in psychology and I had a particularly good professor for a class called Abnormal Psychology. He told us that when shopping for a counselor or psychiatrist for a specific problem (and yes, you are the customer and they are the product) you ought to ask these three questions:

Before allowing anyone to treat you, you ought to ask these three questions:

-Did you actually take a class in this disorder?

-Have you done any research with this disorder?

-Were you ever supervised by a professional who has done the first two things while working with clients?

Their answers to these questions can tell you a lot about what to expect from their counseling. 

Good luck! There are some amazing professionals out there and hopefully this helps you find them!"
kegoif,xboxone,Game Pass Ultimate troubles,"Hey guys delete if not allowed but I can't seem to get help anywhere. My Game Pass Ultimate subscription expired yesterday and I renewed it about an hour later. When I tried starting up some EA games I had previously downloaded, I got a pop up saying that I wasn't the owner of the game. I tried deleting the game and reinstalling it but I only got the option to pay for the EA Pass. Can anyone please tell me how to fix this?"

kegsz0,LifeProTips,"LPT, Brush your teeth when you wake up and after every meal when sick.","Your immune system has several jobs and works in several ways.  Taking care of unfamiliar objects in your mouth is one job of your immune system, so brushing your teeth frees up resources to fight bugs elsewhere.

Your mouth is frequently one of the major battlefields of a germ war, and toothpaste will kill some of the germs.

One of the ways your body disposes of germs is ejection (e.g. coughing, sneezing), brushing will make sure those germs don't reenter your body.

You will tend to drink water after brushing, and hydration is important when sick.  I often have trouble drinking water when I'm sick because of ""mouth crud,"" but can drink after brushing.

Finally, it reduces the germs in your mouth, making you less likely to spread your cold to others.

Side note, many of these also apply to showers/baths... So shower/bathe more often while sick too."
kegteo,gaming,"Valve Complete Pack, or the Witcher 3?","I have 14$ in my steam wallet, and I am not in a position to add extra funds to that. The winter Steam sale is coming around, so I wanted a masterpiece to play to make up for the disappointment of Cyberpunk. The two games (technically one is a bundle) I have my eyes on are Valve Complete Pack, and the Witcher 3. I am a fan of both rpgs and fps games, so I'm pretty split with the decision. I've looked into all of the Half Life & Portal lore and I'm pretty hooked on it. I'm also watching a playthrough of the Witcher and its a pretty interesting story. So, which would you recommend, the Witcher or the Valve games? An replies are greatly appreciated!"

I can load Apps like YouTube and Netflix with no issues but anytime I try to load a game it beeps and turns off.

keh1mk,gaming,Is Cyberpunk going to be the new Skyrim?,"So, I searched this topic up after a week or so of being released. I think that this is going to ring more true with time. As of now, my simple observational analysis is this. Both have bugs that would sink any other triple A game and both have stories that are good but not groundbreaking. Cyberpunk still needs to stand the test of time, and still needs to retain some the fanfare a bit, but the fans are acting as the fans were when Skyrim was first released."

Assign it as shortcut to an application that does nothing like rundll32.exe in your System folder,"Ever since I got my new laptop, this has been driving me crazy until I got used to position of the F keys (so close to each other). There were a lot of options like using registry editors, 3rd party applications, etc.. etc..  then I thought about finding an executable that does nothing and assign it, and the only thing that does nothing is rundll32.exe by itself (I guess it needs an argument or something to function properly, like every married couple) 

Just creat a shortcut of this anywhere in your computer, go to properties and assign shortcut F1."
keh7sh,gaming,Looking for a Battle Royale game that is similar to how Fortnite was in the beginning,"Hi!

I used to play a lot of Fortnite - never been great at it, but I loved the concept of the game. Lately I've found it hard to keep up with all the Marvel-based content they have been releasing, as I'm admittedly not a Marvel fan, but on top of that it feels like there is so much to get done in one season that I don't know where to begin, and I'm honestly not interested in the game anymore as it feels so clogged up with promotional skins and stuff, I feel like it's kind of lost what made it so awesome in the beginning.

I was hoping there is a more 'simple' Battle Royale game out there for me, kind of how Fortnite used to be where you had simple tasks to complete, without necessarily needing to keep up with the story.

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

Thank you :)"

Watching the film again I’m actually shocked this made it into the final cut. It’s awkward and almost refuses to be taken seriously. 

Everything about this scene is awkward, the glass breaks out of nowhere, and DeNiro is kicking him with the worst sound effects, I’m honestly shocked Scorsese didn’t think to take this out.

Maybe it’s because it was for Netflix that people weren’t as pressured to make the film as good as it should be, but just completely shocked this goofy scene actually made it in."

They are discriminating against students who are victims of rape/incest, or who can't afford or do not want an abortion, or who just simply had sex and now have to deal with raising a child potentially on their own, with all the handicaps that that brings. Do they kick out male students for knocking up female students? If they don't then that is a horrible double standard. Many things in the movie Precious disgusted me and opened my eyes to how hard some youths have it, but for her to get kicked out of high school because of something that she didn't want to have happen to her is deplorable."

When I was younger my dad and I shared a rubbish lil laptop.

Since 2020 has been pretty rough and I know my dad has been pretty stressed out my idea was to buy something similar to him for christmas. The problem is that this game series is now only available for console as of my understanding? We don’t own one, I however own a pc and my dad has access to a standard laptop trough his job, not sure how much he is allowed use that for personal stuff though.

I quite frankly asked him what games he would like if not a hockey game and car racing was his answer. My dilemma is that I don’t know which one. 

I would like the game to playable by two people on one computer only, so me and my dad using my pc, not sure what the term for that is. 

If my dad then gets his own laptop or if he is allowed to use his work laptop I would also like the game to be fairly straightforward so that he could play himself. Not to bash my dad but technology really isn’t his thing, it happens that he asks me for help on how to properly connect to our Wi-Fi."

* I would definitely prefer HDR and FreeSync

The kicker is that I really don't want to spend any more than $250 USD. I know it might be hard to find a worthwhile monitor that meets these specs for that price, so if you think I should just hang onto my current monitor until prices drop, let me know that too!

1.	Make different effects for food and drinks you pickup. Almost all have the same weak effect and I always sell them.
2.	When selling an item that you have lots of, make it so the when you hold down the right button, the numbers of items to sell speeds up. It’s annoying to have to wait for it to slowly get to 100.


There are mods for these fixes/changes:

1.	Lower the sensitivity when driving. Make it “stickier”.
2.	Switch the “start” button and “back” button on Xbox controllers, so that “start” brings up the game options menu & pause, and “back” brings up the items/missions/etc... I would assume PS controllers have the same issue."

keixk0,cars,ELI5 - Automatics behaving briefly like a CVT (increase in speed while revs stay consistent),"Hi all, question here and don't know how else to ask without explaining (sorry for the dumb post title).

I'm wondering what's happening when my automatic car seems to hold a gear at a steady RPM while at the same time accelerating. For a brief period of time, the automatic seems to be working like a CVT. Rather than speed increasing in conjunction with the RPMs increasing in whatever gear, the car shifts to a different gear, seems to hold the engine at 3K (example) while speeds increase from 20-35 MPH (also example). Eventually it hits a point where the RPMs start to rise with speed until the next shift. But there is a period time that I always think ""is this what it's like to drive a CVT?""

My current car is a Honda Accord with the 2.0T engine and 10 speed automatic. It doesn't happen all the time, and it's happened in every automatic transmission vehicle i've ever driven. I think it's more circumstantial (low speeds, accelerating, and a shift just happening but those are just guesses based on the last time I remember this happening) vs something that happens all the time. I wouldn't describe the shifts as ""hard"" or even slipping, but I know nothing.  

Can anyone explain what's happening here? I've done my own Googling and can't figure it out. Something to do with the torque converter?

i always tend to go the completionist route in games like this, fetching all the collectables scattered through the map, doing all the side quests before the main one, getting the most broken gear to demolish bosses in one hit is a feeling that never gets old for me, what does instead is this loop of get to point A to B in a straight line for hours and hours using fast travel as much as possible every time.

driving around night city hasn't lost it's charm to me even after many hours of play, calling jackie's bike, turning 180° because it always arrives from the damn wrong direction and speed towards my next objective still feels as new as the first time i did it, especially during night time when the city is at it's best, and each time i get views of night city never seen before.

However, with everything that this game promised and with its half-fleshed out features, my only regret is having paid $80.

The more I look into other RPG games to scratch the itch that Cyberpunk couldn’t, I’m continuously met by MSRPs that are significantly lower for even more content. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the first comparison, which for the same price has WAY more content.  Other RPGs, like the Outer Worlds, released with a much lower price.

Outside off those sections however, is a lifeless bore of a world where nothing happens. The only point of the open world is to keep the game seem longer than it is by telling us to go from point A to point B.

kej6av,cyberpunkgame,Found out what bothers me about CP 2077's quest design. (I think),"In more traditional RPGs, there will usually be an indicator of what type of quest you're about to get into, whether that be along the lines of a (more or less) non-combat one, heavy combat one, fetch questy one. I feel that that's an aspect CP 2077 heavily overlooked, as I suspect a majority of players share the approach of ""vetting"" quests, before they decide to get into one. Sort out those that they suspect won't be interesting to them, whether it's because they don't like the quest-giver or theme of the quest.  
  
In CP 2077 however, you'll either get a briefing by only a handful of fixers or you can choose to go directly to markers, only to find out halfway through the quest that you weren't looking to get into another 10 minute factory shootout and pickup-item quest. There doesn't seem to be traditional emerging quests, where NPCs simply approach you, or flag you down, or drag (and captivate) you into their storyline one way or another.  
  
I'm genuinely missing the experience of getting pulled into events as I go about my way, as opposed to deliberately straying away from the plot to go out of my way and to one of the trillion markers on the map."

km2apy,movies,"This past weekend, I watched Die Hard 2 and 3 for the first time. Not sure which is better but DH2 doesn’t seem to get the credit it deserves.","A few years back I watched Die Hard for the first time during Christmas week. For some reason I put off watching the rest of the series until this past weekend. I have HBO Max so I watched Die Hard for Christmas then the following 2 the next 2 days. 

I read and watched reviews and rankings about this series without spoilers. It seems like Die Hard 2 is usually the least preferred of the trilogy. It also seems like DH2 is often only ranked above Die Hard 5, which is universally known to be the worst. I read somewhere that the trilogy was the actual Die Hard series with Die Hard 4 and 5 being Bruce Willis action movies that happened to be titled Die Hard. 

After watching the trilogy, DH1 is still the best and my favorite, but I’m not sure I’ll join the popular opinion that Die Hard 3 is better than DH2. First, what DH3 does better is that it has a better villain who gets a great [soundtrack bit](https://youtu.be/x8Rj7x4_zRo) (though DH2’s villain was good enough), doesn’t have an annoying asshole cop/G man that opposes McClane the whole time (Lorenzo in Die Hard 2 was so annoying), Zeus was a great addition as a fellow main protagonist, and in general, DH3 shakes up the formula more. 

A lot of people not only rank DH2 towards the bottom of the series but also think it’s just a mediocre action flick. I still like DH2 a lot as an action film and think it’s great. It might be too similar to DH1 for some, but I appreciate the continuity. It feels more like a continuation than DH3 does. Like DH1, DH2 is also Christmas themed, takes place mostly at night, and brings back several characters who are in similar roles (I liked that Powell was back but disliked how he was barely in it). DH3 is good but seems a lot different from the first 2, taking place mostly in daylight, it’s not Christmas themed, and no one except McClane returns. I know the differences are what they were going for though. DH3 also has a more abrupt final battle and ending. Not as satisfying as DH2’s imo. And is it just me, or does DH3 have the least amount of McClane screen time of the trilogy? 

Perhaps DH2 is too similar to DH1, even down to using the same Christmas song at the very end, but there are enough differences to be valued. 

Now for it not getting enough credit. Well, it was released only 2 years after DH1, so it’s surprising that it’s even as good and big as it is. This year was its 30th anniversary, and unless I missed it, I didn’t really see a whole lot of attention brought to it like DH1 had for its 30th anniversary 2 years ago. DH2 is the only other Christmas film of the series, yet it doesn’t really seem to get the attention most other Christmas films get during the season.

Was/is DH2 viewed as too dark and bleak? Admittedly, it’s the darkest and bleakest of the three films. The villains are the most evil and brutal of the series, and that is shown through the people they kill."

My grip here though is that once I got my ending (pretty shit and enfuriating space ending) when the credits finally roll you can then select “one more gig”. I press that, and the game loads, but straight back to the credits, so I now miss out on endgame gear? Is there no way around this.

Thankfully I made a save outside the door to embers BEFORE going in, but seems pretty fucking shit that I have to reload that save and can’t just “carry on” from the end of the final mission/epilogue.

Anyone else had this issue? And for the life of me that fucking space ending is the worst one in the whole game, just sitting in a fucking chair repeating the same shit for nearly 30 odd minutes. Jesus 🤣"

kntpa4,movies,"Funny Games, Michael Haneke 1997","While I wouldn't say it's Hanekes best, Funny Games is perhaps his most memorable and iconic. Something really interesting tends to happen when these established art-house directors like Claire Denis or Lynn Ramsey use genre to explore their themes - often subverting or at least adapting its tropes to suit their artistic agenda. Too me a least, this is home invasion at its most uncomfortable and horrifying - and Haneke had very specific ideas about how character function in the narrative. Taking a humanist approach, he avoids easy explanations of degenerate behavior by use of xenophobic othering or fears of the lower class - Peter and Paul even mock these types of ideas in the film.

Fourth wall breaking has a very interesting function as well - making it clear that the violence and injustice is as much aimed at us as spectators as the family itself. Our expectations are upended, and the narrative twists cruelly to prove Hanekes point - we are subject to media and its manipulations. But this is also his most mischievous and funny film. It isn't just Arno Frisch's character but also Haneke winking at us - and its a good reminder that while he is typically thought of as very seriously minded, even a little cold and calculated, a sense of humor can be spotted in how he relates to us as viewers. There is an element of glee in how things go bad, and the hurdles his character go through.

I really like how he uses violence - its direct, impactful and has consequence. Characters are properly vulnerable, which increases our sense of unease. But he also uses the violence of language and demonstrates what power name-calling and condescension has over a persons sense of self.

What are you're thoughts on the film?

IMO:

This is a pathetic response.

I don't think ""It's a trope"" is a defense in any way and the movie does nothing to engage, analyze, critique, or subvert the trope - it just reiterates and repeats it.

I really think Jenkins thinks her script is a lot stronger than it is - this may have been her intent but it wouldn't be the only aspect of the movie that is underdeveloped and poorly explained - and ultimately it doesn't come across in the final film that the trope is being critiqued."

kntrhi,movies,The Phantom Carriage (1921) - IMO the greatest New Year's Eve horror film,"The Phantom Carriage is to New Year’s Eve as Dickens’ Christmas Carol is to Christmas. It tells the tale of a truly despicable man, David, who makes first act Scrooge seem like third act Scrooge. David is selfish, alcoholic, violent, diseased, heartless and just an outright prick; genuinely one of the evilest lead characters in any film I’ve seen.

&#x200B;

The plot then has the monumental task of attempting to redeem this horrid character, like Scrooge, via the power of a helpful ghost. David dies at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve and is visited by the ghost, death’s driver for the year who is to pass over the role to David, but first takes David back to his most heinous moments and the longstanding consequences of his various actions up to the present moment. In the end, The Phantom Carriage becomes genuinely affecting, emotional, and perhaps even upsettingly relatable. 

&#x200B;

The film is also well known for its groundbreaking use of double exposure. It was already a tried-and-true effect by 1921, but the Swedish filmmakers pushed the boundaries; for example, they successfully showed the ghostly carriage being obscured by foreground objects. Famous fans of the film include Bergman (whose Death figure in The Seventh Seal can be traced back to the Carriage driver) and Kubrick (who directly lifted a scene and updated it for a particularly iconic bathroom scene in The Shining).

&#x200B;

Seeing as we’re all stuck inside this New Year’s, now is the time to cosy up and watch this ghostly classic.

knzugg,xboxone,Does anyone know how to fix error 0x800700b7,I recently encounted this error and its preventing me from loading most of my games I cannot find any way to fix this and I'm not sure how to?
knzutr,cars,What do you guys think of adhesive hood ornaments?,"I want to get my friend a hood ornament for her birthday, she’s mentioned she’s wanted one. If I get a legit one, I feel like I’d end up installing it, which I could do, but it wouldn’t be a great job, as I’m worried about rust and whatnot. So, I began shopping for adhesive hood ornaments. I’m worried if it accidentally gets removed, it will jack up the paint. I’m also worried if it falls off while she’s driving it could hit the windshield. I could just be making up these fears in my head though. Do you guys think adhesive hood ornaments are alright to use?"
knzwlw,xboxone,Game clips record my friends voices but not mine,"Hello guys, 
Whenever I have recorded a clip lately, my friends voices are in it but not mine. I have used Xbox party chat, and in game chat and it still records theirs and not mine. I would prefer if it was going to record theirs to record mine as well. Or, just not have any voices. Is there a fix for this? Don’t have an example sorry."
knzwym,xboxone,Found 2 roach's in the Xbox I just bought,I don't think there's any more in there but im not sure what I should do it works find as of right now I bought it off marketplace on Facebook and I bagged it up my Xbox in a air tight bag when I found them in there and I'm not confident enough to take it apart myself what should I do?
knzx17,movies,Better movie: Quest for the Holy Grail (1975) or Life of Brian (1979)?,"What is the best Monty Python movie: Quest for the Holy Grail or Life of Brian? Both are very funny movies with each having a multitude of memorable scenes? For me, Quest for the Holy Grail edges out Life of Brian. Quest has the Black Knight, the insulting Frenchman, the witch trial and many more. That's not to say Life of Brian has any shortage of amazing sketches. There's the stoning, the Judean People's Front, and the ""What have the Romans ever done for us?"" argument. It's just so funny."

knzz9s,gaming,Games Similar to Tom Clancy’s Splint Cell?,"While I’ve been back home recently for the holidays, I’ve re-discovered Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory for the GameCube. Such a classic game I put a lot of hours on as a kid. I’m not a huge gamer now but what are some similar, more modern, games like the splinter cell series? I’m currently using a ps4. I know Tom Clancy has rainbow 6 siege and stuff like that but I’m not really interested in playing online. People who are familiar with the Splinter Cell series: what’s a ps4 game that has a similar solo gameplay/ campaign as Splinter Cell? Thanks.

ko034u,LifeProTips,LPT: Remember to prepare your pets and their space for New Year’s celebration fireworks so you don’t start 2021 looking for a lost & frightened pet.,"Prep your pets and their space for New Year’s Eve fireworks now so you don’t start 2021 looking for a lost & frightened pet.

Even the most mellow of pets can get spooked by unexpected loud noises and bright lights. 

It seems safe to assume that some neighbor is going to set of fireworks at midnight tonight to celebrate the end of 2021. Take the time now to be sure your pets (reactive or not) have a safe space during the upcoming fireworks and that  they can’t get outside. Also, if they need time for meds or calming treats to kick in, start them soon.  

I’m betting the people who set off loud fireworks in residential neighborhoods this summer and fall kept some for tonight and don’t care that they are scaring people and pets with surprise booms and flashes (If you are one of those people, your neighbors do not appreciate surprise fireworks—the fireworks may be pretty but your neighbors with babies/young children, pets, PTSD, or sleep problems hate being jolted out of a sound sleep by an explosion). 

I’m on New York time and just gave my reactive pup her calming CBD oil and shut her dog door so she can’t bolt into the backyard. I also put her favorite blanket and toy by the chair where she likes to retreat during fireworks. 

Good luck, stay safe, and give your fuzzy, furry, or scaly family members a extra scratch from me!  Welcome 2021!"
ko03u6,Games,"With 93% positive reviews and over 11,000 reviews. Medieval Dynasty is my sleeper success hit of 2020.","With an extremely immersive experience.  For a small, 15 person company this is a great achievement. Also, the updates have been substantial and very frequent compared to other companies. 

Obviously, the game is not for everyone. But I highly recommend keeping your eye on it."
ko042t,gaming,Remnant from the ashes split screen?,I'm confused about this game. On ps4 it says offline coop 2 to 3 players yet people say it doesn't have split screen?
ko045k,windows,"Something I always wondered: what's the technical reason we can't have a utility that easily migrates you whole from one Windows machine to another, docs, apps, and user settings? Apple can--I know the basics of why. But what prevents that simplicity on Windows?","I've been on Windows as long as any of you; 3.1 was the shit. I've been on Apple and various Unixes and Linuxes just as long.

For the unaware, migrating as an example your Macbooks is as simple as tethering them, hitting 'go', and the next day the 'you' in the older, slower laptop has been cloned whole into the new laptop, down to the application and settings levels. You basically copy yourself into a new OS and hardware container.

I know Windows is a *much* bigger ecosystem, the foundational underlying differences, and all... but while I know things like the Linux subsystems and kernel and so on well, I don't pretend to even slightly know the Windows side as well. I've never professionally worked Windows but as the sometimes side thing, or for my work laptops, but I live generally in the nix world.

What's stopping the rocket scientists on the Windows side from making such a clone migration as stupidly easy? Surely it's got to be possible by now?

I'm just settling into the thought of migrating a Windows work machine for the first time in probably 15+  years; I'd been on Linux and Mac laptops for that long, until the last three years back on a Windows laptop. I'm already resigned to having to side-by-side the machines for some time as I find and reinstall anything I use application-wise, cloning various values that I fine tuned... making sure my cheese is in the right place... 

...and lusting for just jamming two Macbooks together at bedtime, pressing go, and waking up to a finished migration...."

ko04x4,gaming,"A few questions about Hades, I feel it may be a very good purchase for me, I'm just not sure.","First off, I'm a pretty casual gamer, and I'm not exactly good. Is Hades tedious in a way BOTW is? In BOTW, the weapons breaking and the goddamn shrines just feel like a chore. Also, is it somewhat similar to Rocket League? Even if I lose in rocket league, I keep coming back to it and can play in short or long spurts. Will Hades just make me play for about ten minutes then stop, or keep my brain calm enough to keep playing it again and again? Just to clarify, no, I did not like BOTW. Is the battle gameplay simple, like is it super quick to beat most enemies, and do they follow me? Does the game get way easier with each run, and can you save at any time? If I somehow beat the game in one run, how long does a single run take(I know impossible). Finally, for a  new gamer( I've had my switch for about a year and a half, and I've never gamed before that), how many runs should I expect to need to beat the game? I'm sorry for asking so many questions, it's just that a few games I've purchased(all triple-a titles)didn't click for me. Thanks!"

ko06sl,gaming,PSA: You deserve to be happy,"So it’s time to put down the CoD, the Fifa/Madden/2K, the R6, the Overwatch, the CSGO, the Valorant, the Battle Royales, and all the garbage you play.

It’s time to be happy.

Stop coming in here posting about losing motivation for gaming when you don’t even game properly.

Treat yourself.

There’s plenty of games out this year: DBZ, Ori, Final Fantasy 7, Persona 5 Royal, REmake 3, Doom Eternal, TLOU2, Ghost of Tsushima, THPS1+2, AC Valhalla, CP2077, literally so much content

But you wanna get sad over trash....over pure smelly garbage.

It’s time to choose better. 

:)

Make 2021 amazing for yourself"
