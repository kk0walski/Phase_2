61,kdy9c8,movies,Is Die Hard a Christmas film? Yes...,"I just had a debate with a friend about this and thought someone could show their opinion (for the record I may get some small points wrong because I am sitting down to watch it in a few days so light me up comments)

Why I believe Die Hard is a christmas film is :
1.Its set at Christmas Eve

2.There are multiple references to the fact that it is Christmas time like trees, the music, the quotes like Twas the night before christmas and I have a machine gun now, ho ,ho ,ho and people wishing John Merry Christmas.

3. The whole plot and plan of Hans Gruber revolves around it being Christmas time...his plan probably wouldnt work if it wasnt Christmas Eve.Let me explain.He wouldnt have been able to round up everyone so easily and so fast if they werent all together for the Christmas party without risking them calling the police.It is also why the first few guards are caught so offguard by John because they had no reason to think anyone had gotten out because it should have been impossible.Also the whole reason John was there was to meet back up with his asstranged wife and kids for Christmas so if it wasnt for it being Christmas he wouldnt have been there

Idk that's just my opinion",I debate friend thought someone could show opinion record I may get small point wrong I sit watch day light comment Why I believe Die Hard christmas film set Christmas Eve multiple reference fact Christmas time like tree music quote like Twas night christmas I machine gun ho ho ho people wish John Merry Christmas The whole plot plan Hans Gruber revolve around Christmas time plan probably wouldnt work wasnt Christmas wouldnt able round everyone easily fast werent together Christmas party without risk call also first guard catch offguard John reason think anyone gotten whole reason John meet back asstranged wife kid Christmas wasnt Christmas wouldnt Idk opinion
62,kdyaqp,Games,"Are AAA studios wildly understaffed, compared to what they would need to never crunch?","""Understaffed"" here could mean one of two things -- either they need more developers period, or they have enough developers but not enough talented developers -- or some combination of both.

If it was just one studio that was known for periods of extreme crunch, you could say maybe their management is uniquely bad at doing things on time. But when it happens at almost every studio, over and over, and many of the resulting games come out to critical acclaim... it strains credulity that ""management is just bad."" 

It seems a lot more plausible that management knows exactly what it's doing, and that they're simply taking some kinds of shortcuts that result in crunch behavior. 

My own work experience tells me that even financially successful companies would sooner engage in criminal behavior than hire enough people to do the work responsibly and legally. 

So is that all there is to it? And if so, is unionization the only solution? 

Or is there some other explanation?",Understaffed could mean one two thing either need developer period enough developer enough talented developer combination If one studio know period extreme crunch could say maybe management uniquely bad thing time But happen almost every studio many result game come critical acclaim strain credulity management bad It seem lot plausible management know exactly simply take kind shortcut result crunch behavior My work experience tell even financially successful company would sooner engage criminal behavior hire enough people work responsibly legally So And unionization solution Or explanation

71,kdygja,cyberpunkgame,Some very simple helpful information for planning your builds,"Here's some information I wish I had when starting my first character. Very simple stuff. Simplest TLDR at the bottom.

**Attribute Points:** Every new character starts with 7 points to work with. Additionally, you will receive 49 points from leveling. This leaves you with a total of **56** attribute points. The base starting score for any attribute is **3**, meaning maximizing an attribute to **20** will take **17** points. With your **56** points, **you can maximize three attributes to 20 with 5 points left over**.

**Skill Progression:** Each attribute has two or three associated skills. For example, Technical Ability has both Crafting and Engineering skills. **A skill's maximum level is capped at the level of its associated attribute.** If your Technical Ability is 3, your crafting can't progress past 3. You level up a skill by using it, and leveling up skills provide rewards. Cold Blood, for example, provides 10% crit chance at level 2. **Each skill provides perk points at various levels of mastery, totaling 7.** There are three exceptions to this -- both Intelligence skills and Crafting only provide 6 skill points for maxing them. This also means that Body and Reflexes provide more perk points than the other attributes. **Body and Reflexes provide a total of 21 perk points, Cool provides 14, Technical Ability 13, and Intelligence 12.**

**Perk Points:** Through leveling your character from 1 to 50, you acquire **49** perk points. Each skill provides **6 or 7** perk points through leveling it to 20. **You may reset your perk points for 100,000 eddies at any ripperdoc.**

**TLDR:** You get **56** total attribute points, meaning **you can max three attributes**. You get **49** perk points from leveling, and **7** from maxing most skills. **Body and Reflexes provide a total of 21 perk points from maxing their associated skills, Cool provides 14, Technical Ability 13, and Intelligence 12.**",Here information I wish I start first character Very simple stuff Simplest TLDR bottom Attribute Points Every new character start point work Additionally receive point level This leave total attribute point The base start score attribute meaning maximize attribute take point With point maximize three attribute point leave Skill Progression Each attribute two three associate skill For example Technical Ability Crafting Engineering skills A skill maximum level cap level associate attribute If Technical Ability crafting ca progress past You level skill use level skill provide reward Cold Blood example provide crit chance level Each skill provide perk point various level mastery total There three exception Intelligence skill Crafting provide skill point maxing This also mean Body Reflexes provide perk point attribute Body Reflexes provide total perk point Cool provide Technical Ability Intelligence Perk Points Through level character acquire perk point Each skill provide perk point level You may reset perk point eddy ripperdoc TLDR You get total attribute point mean max three attribute You get perk point level maxing skill Body Reflexes provide total perk point maxing associated skill Cool provide Technical Ability Intelligence

One thing I’ve noticed with the newest models of *most* cars is that the interiors look and feel very cheap. I think it’s because of the digital dash in place of analog dials, as well as all the gloss black buttons that use haptics instead of actual buttons. One of the brands that I think has suffered the most from this is BMW, which in my opinion used to have a simple but elegant interior, where all the touch points felt luxurious and well-built.

118,kdztpv,windows,"Windows 10 network connectivity keeps dropping, wired and wireless","Ok, so this is a bit of a stumper. Using an Eluktronics laptop, very nice system, rock-solid for a good, long time. My wife has a Dell Inspirion. We are both experiencing weird behaviors with Windows 10. Connected to wifi, connected to ethernet, no internet. 

My laptop uses an intel dual-band AC 8265 card that handles the ethernet and wifi. 

We have wifi in the back of the house with an extender but I use an ethernet over powerline adapter and run ethernet directly to the computer because wifi is a little too wonky for work connections. 

What I'm experiencing now is wifi will drop out intermittently. My ethernet will do the same thing. Rebooting the computer brings it back. 

So I did the usual of uninstall the adapter, let it autodetect again, update the drivers, delete it and the drivers and add them back in, flush DNS and reset ipv4 and ipv6, no good. I even got an additional USB wifi adapter to see if maybe it's just a driver conflict and it won't connect, either. If I connect the laptop directly to the router the speed is fast, when it works. But sometimes it'll refuse to see the router without a reboot. 

Meanwhile, while these Windows machines have trouble connecting, I have zero problem with our cell phones, chromebook, television with rokus, all of them connect to the wifi just fine. 

So, given that the problem is limited to Windows machines, my suspicion is that there's something going wrong pending a Windows update and I think the problem is inherent to Windows since it's failing wifi and ethernet on the same card and fails for the usb wifi as well. 

Someone pointed out that there's a hidden item in device manager that's the microsoft tool for adding hotspots. Kill it and that can resolve some issues but it didn't work for me. 

In googling I've seen Windows 10 networking issues out the wazoo, a lot of people are having issues, many seem similar to mine, and the common solutions aren't working.",Ok bit stumper Using Eluktronics laptop nice system good long time My wife Dell Inspirion We experience weird behavior Windows Connected wifi connect ethernet internet My laptop use intel AC card handle ethernet wifi We wifi back house extender I use ethernet powerline adapter run ethernet directly computer wifi little wonky work connection What I experience wifi drop intermittently My ethernet thing Rebooting computer bring back So I usual uninstall adapter let autodetect update driver delete driver add back flush DNS reset good I even get additional USB wifi adapter see maybe driver conflict wo connect either If I connect laptop directly router speed fast work But sometimes refuse see router without reboot Meanwhile Windows machine trouble connect I zero problem cell phone chromebook television rokus connect wifi fine So give problem limited Windows machine suspicion something go wrong pending Windows update I think problem inherent Windows since fail wifi ethernet card fail usb wifi well Someone point hidden item device manager microsoft tool add hotspot Kill resolve issue work In google I see Windows network issue wazoo lot people issue many seem similar mine common solution work

The DLC in the near future aren't new missions (well there would be new missions obviously :T ) they're the next acts. Which brings up some questions. Would there be a choice of which ""ending"" to go off of or will it just continue after you get the ending?

In my play through of the game at a ""ripper doc"" when I go to upgrade some things in a slot there isn't any cyberware in that slot so I wonder if they haven't put that stuff in yet ( in other words: BE!! PAITENT!! and wait till CD red puts in the missing stuff >:T ) speaking of cyberware I wonder if there would be grapple claws and scissor hands ( I know they won't put that in because non of my ideas would come to light but it would be nice plus I wouldn't care if they say it was there idea first I would just be happy that it existed in the game <:) )

As for some other cyberware ideas how about ""blast triple jump"" (it's like the double jump but after the third jump your legs will shoot whoever's under you it might even work with a slide too ;3 ) there can be even cheetah legs that'll make you run fast as a sports car, as for spider palms they'll go in the slot where the ammo counter thing goes.

The spider palms would have the ability to allow you to climb walls like a spider.

Speaking of animal cyberware I wonder if that's what that glitchy stat slot is. ( in your stats there's a slot that when you hover the curser over it that slot bugs out ) meaning in the near future we could get cat ears and tails :3 also tattoo parlors, plastic surgeons, makeup stores and barber shops/ salons.

I recently rewatched How the Grinch Stole Christmas - the one with Jim Carrey. Possibly for the first time i actually *watched* the movie as an adult. 

I, like many of you, have seen the movie countless times, whether it be playing at my house as kid, a Christmas party, in grade-school, in college (we actually watched this movie in my Theories of Personalities class) or just in the background during Christmas time - but never really paid attention to it. 

Anyways, I just sat down and watched it again and wow - The movie is just kinda *meh* and a little creepy. I thought to myself, ""If anyone else knew i didn't like this movie, I would be put on a very naughty list.""

I was sure this movie was rated highly on Rotten Tomatoes so I looked it up. (Rotten by users and critics)[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_the_grinch_stole_christmas]

Following in the footsteps of How The Grinch Stole Christmas, three years later The Cat in the Hat is released.

They seem to follow the same formula:

Legendary Dr. Seuss book

Whacky comedian Mike Meyers replaces Jim Carrey following his incredible success with Shrek.

We are talking single-digit Rotten Tomato scores and breaking even on budget. 


The phenomenon is that even though How the Grinch Stole Christmas isn't regarded as good movie but really any review, ratings, or box office scores, at this point it's truly blasphemous to say you dont like How the Grinch Stole Christmas. There's no metric for that, but try it. Try it at your family Christmas-whatever.

150,ke0kxy,movies,I frankly unabashedly hated Tenet,"All the cinemas where I live were closed because of the lockdown when it arrived. 
I just had the opportunity to see it for the first time and boy... what an awful film. It's in my view Nolan's worst film. 
I love Nolan I think he is one of the best filmmakers working today. Inception, prestige are two of my favourite films of all time. Even films considered flawed like dark knight rises and interstellar I loved but this was a unique specie. It was horrible. 

The word convoluted would be an understatement. We would need to invent a new word. Now I understand what the rejoinder would be. It'd go something like hey Nolan makes his movie in such a way that you need to watch them multiple times to fully comprehend what's going on.(Such was the case with inception as well as interstellar after all)

But the difference here is I was invested in those stories. I was intrigued. They managed to engross me such that when they were over I immediately rewatched them(something I don't usually do) to better understand the concepts and themes of said films yes but also to relive and savour some of their amazing moments

Here I found myself desperately wishing for film to be over and when it did I went to the Wikipedia page to read its plot summary and was barely able to finish it. Even its plot summary proved tedious and immensely boring to read. 
Like what was he thinking? How can he or people at warner bros came to greenlight this garbage of a script?

People were raving about amazing action set pieces but even they were too confusing to follow. And became quickly monotonous.

The only good thing I can say is that it's actors did a good job. I liked Denzel Washington's son, and the score was good. Some scenes in reverse looked visually impressive but for a great film maker like Nolan this is and should be a low-bar.

I hope in the future he spends more time improving his scripts. I hope he does better next time because I want him to make great movies.  He is a gifted artist who seems to legitimately love his craft.",All cinemas I live close lockdown arrive I opportunity see first time boy awful film It view Nolan worst film I love Nolan I think one best filmmaker work today Inception prestige two favourite film time Even film consider flaw like dark knight rise interstellar I love unique specie It horrible The word convolute would understatement We would need invent new word Now I understand rejoinder would It go something like hey Nolan make movie way need watch multiple time fully comprehend go Such case inception well interstellar But difference I invest story I intrigue They manage engross I immediately rewatched something I usually well understand concept theme say film yes also relive savour amaze moment Here I find desperately wish film I go Wikipedia page read plot summary barely able finish Even plot summary prove tedious immensely bore read Like think How people warner bros come greenlight garbage script People rave amazing action set piece even confuse follow And become quickly monotonous The good thing I say actor good job I like Denzel Washington son score good Some scene reverse look visually impressive great film maker like Nolan I hope future spends time improve script I hope well next time I want make great movie He gift artist seem legitimately love craft

But I tried Destiny 2 on Stadia last month since it is completely free to play (no subscription fee or signup fee or anything), and found that Stadia actually works really well for my internet connection. So this month I bought CP 2077 (also because they were giving away chromcast + controller with the game). I have not had any performance issues so far. 

I hear so many horror stories out there about CP 2077 performance on last gen consoles, and it baffles me that there's this completely viable alternative out there for you guys and it's hardly being mentioned.

It literally takes 10 seconds to link your existing google account with Stadia, and start playing Destiny 2. You have nothing to lose to try it out and see if Stadia works for you.

Then, if Stadia does work for you, now you have a choice of returning the game for your last gen console, and buy it on Stadia instead. Good luck!

My friends and I are discussing on whether The Fugitive (1993) deserved the average sequel, US Marshals (1998). 

I'm kind of torn on it, I enjoyed both films but honestly, I think it would have been better as a standalone rather than a sequel. One friend specifically thinks that it was a fine sequel, while my other friend thinks it was unnecessary. My father loves US Marshals more than The Fugitive but was unaware that they were related haha.

What did you guys think? I think it would have been better as a standalone kind of like Hobbs and Shaw, I think that movie should have been a stand-alone as well.

In the same vein, go for a visit around mid-January. As these items are usually loaded into inventory systems as separate seasonal products, big box stores will often apply a discount without having an actual employee assess the value in an attempt to clear ""Christmas"" stock.

183,ke1849,gaming,Concept: Fight yourself? Idea to innovate shooters.,"I was playing a game the other day and thought while fighting a boss, it would be cool if the boss looked like my character and I was fighting myself (mostly because I enjoy making my character look ridiculous and we have the option of fighting in Bermuda shorts, while the enemy is in full armor).

Then I thought, what if the boss actually was me and I had to fight myself. It would be cool to fight a boss that was based on your stats and did everything you did during fights. If you always seek cover, he would always seek cover. If you threw a ton of grenades, you now have to deal with that. Many games provide players with these seemingly random stats (which I actually appreciate), so I can’t imagine it would be too difficult to refer to those stats for particular encounters. 

Top tier players would encounter challenging bosses. Less adept players may realize how poorly they play and potentially become better and actually learn from their doppelgänger.

I have no idea if this concept has been developed in other game, I just thought it was an interesting idea and wanted to share it. If it has never been considered or actioned, maybe this post and input from others can be a seed that finds its way to the folks that can do something productive with it.

But here’s the thing. You should speak needlessly, and elaborate your points and speak in complete sentences. Not because it’s the polite thing to do but because people, strangers in particular, come armed with skepticism, fearfulness, and other negative emotions towards you. Because they don’t know you yet. It’s the natural thing to do, to be wary of strangers. They’re in an apprehensive state. 

When you talk in longer answers, you disarm them of some of those negative emotions. They see you relaxed, open and comfortable with conversation. It makes you more approachable and easier to bond with.

I was extra curious because of the presence of Helen Mirren and Sarah Polley (thanks Baron Munchausen!) She was in Dawn of the Dead later but that's beside the point.

During this period of time, I watched so many amazing movies. This one has stuck with me. Partially because Robert John Burke (of Robocop 3 fame at the time) was in the starring role. And partially because the story was just so damn cool and unique.

221,ke2arl,gaming,Cyberpunk = Borderlands.,"Honestly, I enjoy the game. But ij describing it to someone today I realized something-- it's not like Witcher, Deus Ex, or other RPGs.

This game feels like fucking Borderlands. It's a shoot and loot with very loose RPG elements that all railroad you through the same storyline regardless of choices. 

Now, is Borderlands a fun game? Hell yeah. BL2 is one of my favorites of all time. But it is not some open world rpg city simulation with 4 different types of AI doing real time responsiveness to player actions, which is what I get the impression CDPR had hyped for years.

So... If you haven't gotten Cyberpunk yet and are thinking about it, change your expectations. It's a beautiful (on PC) shoot n loot with some fun stealth mechanics, some skill tree customization for combat, and some mediocre combat AI that really only poses a threat when it's a boss or outlevels you...

254,ke3b4j,movies,For anyone that complains about main characters making stupid decisions — watch Run.,"One of my biggest pet peeves in movies is when the supposedly smart protagonist makes a ludicrously stupid decision because that was the only way the writers could think to move the plot along; or conversely, an objectively dumb character wins the day because of unbelievable plot contrivances. Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by *Run* a Hulu film made by the same directing duo behind *Searching* (a great mystery-thriller from a few years ago). For those who don’t know, the film is about a sheltered teenage girl afflicted by numerous health conditions who begins to suspect that her mother is fabricating and causing her illnesses to keep her vulnerable and in constant need of care. Now while I don’t think the film is perfect (I generally take issue with the motivations of the mother), I think the daughter, Chloe, is one of the best recent examples of a smart protagonist who constantly makes decisions that are both understandable and actually reasonable in her attempt to escape her situation. The film very smartly establishes that as a sheltered, homeschooled child, Chloe has built up a lot of hobbies and that require a specific and unique set of skills, and then lets each of these skills serve a specific purpose in the escape from her mother. This makes all of her decisions and the subsequent plot reveals feel earned, and never contrived for the sake of moving the story along. Furthermore, whenever possible, Chloe chooses caution over results, making sure she isn’t caught by her mother, which is a very natural and relatable reaction to her situation. She is in a position of weakness and uncertainty so it’s understandable that she doesn’t take unnecessary risks. What makes the film even more compelling is that her mother is frequently a step ahead of her, making it a real battle of wits between the two for Chloe to win. And frequently, Chloe’s clever solution to a problem is stymied because her mother has an explanation and/or plan for everything. Ultimately, this film is a thrill to watch because it leverages our natural capacity for fear and anxiety while never asking us to break our suspension of disbelief when one of the two main characters gain the upper-hand, which is a sorely missing aspect from most modern thrillers. I’d love to hear what people think about this film, as it’s a surprise favorite of mine this year.",One big pet peeve movie supposedly smart protagonist make ludicrously stupid decision way writer could think move plot along conversely objectively dumb character win day unbelievable plot contrivance Which I pleasantly surprise Run Hulu film make direct duo behind Searching great year ago For dont know film shelter teenage girl afflict numerous health condition begin suspect mother fabricate cause illness keep vulnerable constant need care Now I dont think film perfect I generally take issue motivation mother I think daughter Chloe one best recent example smart protagonist constantly make decision understandable actually reasonable attempt escape situation The film smartly establish shelter homeschooled child Chloe build lot hobby require specific unique set skill let skill serve specific purpose escape mother This make decision subsequent plot reveals feel earn never contrive sake move story along Furthermore whenever possible Chloe chooses caution result make sure isnt caught mother natural relatable reaction situation She position weakness uncertainty understandable doesnt take unnecessary risk What make film even compel mother frequently step ahead make real battle wit two Chloe win And frequently Chloes clever solution problem stymie mother explanation plan everything Ultimately film thrill watch leverage natural capacity fear anxiety never ask u break suspension disbelief one two main character gain sorely miss aspect modern thriller Id love hear people think film surprise favorite mine year

259,ke3fkx,gaming,We are all at fault for Cyberpunk – and many other games that fell short,"I am posting this in /r/gaming because this is my personal general reflection on the state of the game industry, including the fans, using Cyberpunk as a primary (but not the single) example.

This post is inspired by this image https://i.redd.it/8f2j1dtxk2561.jpg (apologies to the OP, I cannot find the thread) and the general ongoing discussion of missing features in /r/cyberpunk.

At first, I saw that image and I thought “wow, that is an embarrassment for CRPR” but after I thought about it a bit more I realized that 90% of those things have 0% impact on gameplay. Then I started looking through the /r/cyberpunk threads and really started to realize how impossible the game was to obtain based on fan expectations. 

Posts like: it’s not an RPG because I can’t customize my apartment, it’s not an open world game because it doesn’t have a police system, it’s not X Y or Z because of some arbitrary thing I want. And it gets way worse, all the way down to it takes me 3 space bars instead of one to load the game https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/ke1fxk/starting_the_game_is_needlessly_long_in_the/ . Can we please go back to complaining about the 5 mins of stupid unescapable ads at the start of games instead of three space bars?

I need to upgrade / customize my apartment? Why? Of the games that allowed that how many times did you realistically go back there? We need dirty cars and car washes? Why? We need a tiered loot system? Why? It sucked in diablo, and it doubly sucks now – Ghost Recon removed it from the game and now it’s 100% better. When is the last time you really though to yourself “oooh I hope I get to play the inventory spread sheet game for the 100 millionth time”. We want 17 different character backgrounds to play the story only 1 time? Why? We need 1000 different activities in an open world game… really? Do you really? How many times did you go back and play poker in RDR? Really? How many times to do you stop for some stupid fetch quest in whatever game? Only once now right?

Now there is no denying that the delivered quality of RDR2 is far better than CP but you can easily make the argument that both games are just as shallow when it comes to the actual gameplay; And while all those nice to haves add to the realism of the game world they shouldn’t come at the cost of fun and should be added only when the true game is really done. 

Disco Elysium is probably the best RPG this year, I didn’t see anyone complaining about the fact that they can’t change their hairstyle, couldn’t customize their ride, etc.

I didn’t see anyone complaining about a lack of loot in Doom Eternal… Id made the best fun FPS in years (seriously go play it) because they were precise on what they wanted to accomplish and ignored all the BS fan noise. 

It’s also worth pointing out that Rockstar delayed the PC version (under great fan protest) so they could concentrate on one single delivery. Something CDPR should have obviously done – that’s clearly a management / financial thing but in retrospect the right decision – ship on whatever platform first then figure out the rest. 

The point of all of this is that the fans are putting too much pressure on devs to deliver every single feature of the last great game and more… it’s impossible to obtain. The laundry list of shit that devs “must” include to be a real “open world” / “rpg” is so ridiculous now that a budget of a billion dollars and 2000 developers can’t possibly deliver on it outside of 30 years.

Pro-tip to all future game devs, never, ever, call your game an RPG or Open World. Nothing short of these games being the equivalent to the Matrix is acceptable now? Well, why not? Because they use the words Open World and RPG together? Call your game an Adventure and make whatever the fuck you really want to make – good or bad.

I was a firm believer until recently that devs should take players feedback and incorporate that into their game. I am now starting to think that devs should go back to the old school game dev where they just do what they want in a clean room and for better or worse deliver what they deliver. 

I believe, and I could be wrong, but I believe if CDPR made the game they wanted to make and not they game everyone wanted them to make it would be far better. And that goes for a ton of games recently when they try and follow the same patterns.

Everyone remember Bioshock? How that blew everyone’s minds? We need more of that and not more of the same.",I post personal general reflection state game industry include fan use Cyberpunk primary single example This post inspire image apology OP I find thread general ongoing discussion miss feature At first I saw image I think wow embarrassment CRPR I think bit I realize thing impact gameplay Then I start look thread really start realize impossible game obtain base fan expectation Posts like RPG I cant customize apartment open world game doesnt police system X Y Z arbitrary thing I want And get way bad way take space bar instead one load game Can please go back complain min stupid unescapable ad start game instead three space bar I need upgrade customize apartment Why Of game allow many time realistically go back We need dirty car car wash Why We need tiered loot system Why It suck diablo doubly suck Ghost Recon remove game well When last time really though oooh I hope I get play inventory spread sheet game millionth time We want different character background play story time Why We need different activity open world game really Do really How many time go back play poker RDR Really How many time stop stupid fetch quest whatever game Only right Now deny deliver quality far well CP easily make argument game shallow come actual gameplay And nice have add realism game world shouldnt come cost fun add true game really do Disco Elysium probably best RPG year I didnt see anyone complain fact cant change hairstyle couldnt customize ride etc I didnt see anyone complain lack loot Doom Eternal Id make best fun FPS year seriously go play precise want accomplish ignore BS fan noise Its also worth point Rockstar delayed PC version great fan protest could concentrate one single delivery Something CDPR obviously do thats clearly management financial thing retrospect right decision ship whatever platform first figure rest The point fan put much pressure devs deliver every single feature last great game impossible obtain The laundry list shit devs must include real open world rpg ridiculous budget billion dollar developer cant possibly deliver outside year future game devs never ever call game RPG Open World Nothing short game equivalent Matrix acceptable Well Because use word Open World RPG together Call game Adventure make whatever fuck really want make good bad I firm believer recently devs take player feedback incorporate game I start think devs go back old school game dev want clean room well bad deliver deliver I believe I could wrong I believe CDPR make game want make game everyone want make would far well And go ton game recently try follow pattern Everyone remember Bioshock How blow everyones mind We need

315,ke4ylt,LifeProTips,LPT: Stick cold feet in hot water for a few minutes and put them in warm socks after drying off to make them feel warm for hours,"TL:DR at bottom

So I have what seems to be chronic icy-feet. I've tried everything from wrapping them in three blankets to taking a warm shower to holding them in front of a fireplace to putting on multiple layers of socks, but nothing seems to work well. That is until today, where I had one of the best ideas I think I've ever had. 

I filled my bathtub ankle high with hot water (if you touch it with your hands, it is nice and hot but you can keep your hand in the water without it feeling like it's scalding you) and stood inside it for five to ten minutes. Although my hands could manage it fine, my feet burned like HELL for the first minute or so because they were so cold, and I had to keep taking them out of the water for a few seconds and putting them back in to relieve the burning. After a minute or so, I noticed the burning decreasing a noticeable amount, and it eventually got to the point to where my feet felt the same amount of heat as my hands. This meant that my feet had finally warmed up, so I carefully got out of the tub and dried my feet with a towel, feeling relieved that they finally stopped feeling like ice blocks.

This is where the second part of my idea came in. I had tried the tub thing once before, but I noticed that my feet went back to freezing within an hour or so. However this time, as soon as my feet were warm and dry, I put on a nice pair of warm socks to retain the heat, and it has been working WONDERS. It has been two and a half hours since I put them in the tub, and only now are they starting to go cold again. This has been the best relief I have ever had for them, and I encourage others with cold feet to try this as well!

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Fill bathtub ankle high with hot water (hot, but warm enough that your hand isn't uncomfortable when you stick it in the water). Put your ice-cold feet in the tub and they will burn like crazy for a minute, and the burning sensation will slowly fade away until it isn't there. This is just your feet warming up and receiving thermal energy from the surrounding water. When your feet stop burning, you can take them out of the tub, dry them, and put on some nice, warm socks to retain the heat. Enjoy your now-warm feet for at least a couple of hours!",TL DR bottom So I seem chronic I try everything wrapping three blanket take warm shower hold front fireplace put multiple layer sock nothing seem work well That today I one best idea I think I ever I fill bathtub ankle high hot water touch hand nice hot keep hand water without feel like scald stand inside five ten minute Although hand could manage fine foot burn like HELL first minute cold I keep take water second put back relieve burning After minute I notice burn decrease noticeable amount eventually get point foot felt amount heat hand This meant foot finally warm I carefully get tub dried foot towel feel relieve finally stop feel like ice block This second part idea come I try tub thing I notice foot go back freeze within hour However time soon foot warm dry I put nice pair warm sock retain heat work WONDERS It two half hour since I put tub start go cold This best relief I ever I encourage others cold foot try well TL DR Fill bathtub ankle high hot water hot warm enough hand uncomfortable stick water Put foot tub burn like crazy minute burn sensation slowly fade away This foot warm receive thermal energy surround water When foot stop burn take tub dry put nice warm sock retain heat Enjoy foot least couple hour

347,ke5jx7,gaming,The test for next gen should be game mechanics more than graphics.,"I hate that companies are concentrating on making games slightly more good looking with better lighting and other details but the gameplay mechanics remain the same.

Games like red dead redemption 2 are really next gen games. The gameplay is so well crafted in terms of walking, shooting etc. Even looting is so well detailed that everything you pick up has its own animation. This game is really a underated gem. Consider GTA San Andreas and GTA 5, even a 6 year old will be able to say which is next gen.

Now let's consider Call of duty 4 modern warfare which came out an eternity ago and call of duty Cold war. They're the same exact game with a few new features which looks better. Battlefield, assassins creed, NFS, they're all the same games. And now it's even worse as companies are remastering old games..what. lol! We're moving backwards.

348,ke5kox,movies,mediocre actors whose careers are largely founded by nepotism?,"First of all I just want to say that nepotism a system not exclusively rampant to the entertainment industry (as in music, Hollywood and even theatre) the legacy admission into an elite university for example, or someone being hired as admin staff at their dad/uncles law firm.   


Nepotism is pretty massive in Hollywood, and like in the professional world, nepotism and being qualified together frequently lead to opportunities. I don't think anyone is going to argue that Daniel Day Lewis isn't a phenomenal actor, but his father Cecil was a respected and knighted poet and so I think it probably opened door for young Daniel that were closed to others. Daniel probably wouldn't still be relevant or lauded if he wasn't actually amazingly talented. 

Lady Gaga is another figure who has similarly fortunate circumstances with extraordinary talent. Germanotta grew up in a penthouse on 5th Avenue with millionaire parents who could afford piano lessons, catholic school and even a guest role on The Sopranos in 2001 when she was 15. Perhaps because of all that privileged breeding she was able to develop her gifts. She has something to say and has been successful in redirecting pop music and even performances and the aesthetic of the late 2000s and early 2010s. Now she is a classic entertainer who will remain in the public consciousness for decades in the vein of Barbra Streisand, Elton John, or Bette Midler. Like Day Lewis, she wouldn't still be relevant if she wasn't actually talented or intelligent about her craft.

I want you to respond with actors who aren't terrible but who have blown you away, people who just give decent performances, but nothing too remarkable. A lot of the time you can chuck this up to typecasting and personalities that are charismatic or that appeal to specific demographics.

    There has been a sad decline in the overall gaming experience; and I feel this has been going on for years. I feel like the consumer keeps perpetuating this decline, and in part has some of the blame. I am calling out to others, we have to start doing something about this. 

      Quite frankly I don't care what we do. From not preordering games, boycotting, or even contacting lawmakers. I am desperate to stop this because I cant even trust a developer anymore, and I feel I have been burnt by even some of my favorite developers. There is no way, some of this stuff should be happening. 

      Even if nobody else cares or even if I get a million down-votes; I am going to pledge to be absolutely done with the lies, and decline of my FAVORITE pastime experience. I actually get anxiety thinking about it. I know I can't be the only one who feels this way.

      I understand being able to purchase what you want but, there is a shift happening with these gaming companies, and I just cant accept it anymore. I used to find preordering games years ago to be some of the best times in my life, but now.... I feel that its just blatant lying about certain products at this point. 

     Please, we have to come together as a gaming community, and start changing what is happening. 
From scam levels of micro transactions, to lies about products before they are released, we have to stop this.

359,ke5toz,LifeProTips,LPT: Teach money your kids early,"About 6 years ago the kids in our neighborhood had been doing lemonade stands every Summer. $1/cup. Pretty typical for around here.

Every weekend, a few kids would get together and set up out on the street corner. They would buy their own lemonade and plastic cups and make their own sign, etc. After all was said and done, every weekend they would profit about $25. And then split it began two or three kids.

About 6 years ago the oldest decided that wasn't enough. So she set up by herself. The first thing she did was cross out the $1 and wrote FREE. And then below that, she wrote “tips appreciated”. The first weekend, after 4 hours she came home with $180 in tips. By herself. She was out of lemonade. Her average take every weekend that Summer was $125. It turns out people don't ask for change when tipping and they often only have a $5 or $10 in their wallet. And they don't mind encouraging “a kid”.

I was floored. But it gets better. The next Summer, she wanted to beat her average. So she stopped keeping the money visible in a jar on the table. More people took pity on her that she wasn't making very much money. Although she never once lied about how much she was making, she let them make their assumptions based on only seeing a few dollars in there at a time. Her weekly average went up to $190. But that's nothing. She decided it was worth it to her to invest in more inventory and worth longer hours. I just sat back and watched the history and evolution of business develop before my eyes. By the end of the Summer she was working 8 hours every Saturday and bringing in about $350. For crappy lemonade. This is a 10 year old girl.

But it gets better. The next year, their son took over the lemonade stand. The daughter moved to another corner and started selling cookies…. That's a whole other story. The son really blew my mind. It occurred to him that he had a lot of traffic. So he talked to a couple of small business owners we go to church with. He convinced the owner of a disaster recovery company to “sponsor” the booth with advertising. So he put their logo on the booth for an extra $200/month for the three months of Summer. And he convinced another company to pay him an additional $200/month for the three months of Summer to set a stack of their flyers (custom designed by him) on the table.

This is still going on every Summer. The oldest is now almost 16 and too busy with college classes to do it anymore. The almost 14 year old son hired his younger sister this last Summer to run things FOR him and he pays her generously. He no longer has to work and pockets about $1000 every month during Summer for doing nothing. He now runs the cookie business as well. Every cup of lemonade gets a coupon for a cookie at half price. Half price for a cookie still quadruples his money just on the cookies.

And now he is considering adding hot chocolate and cookies in Winter. And the lemonade is still free…. But tips are appreciated. Haha!

I keep expecting him to start collecting email addresses and zip codes and to sign up for Square so he can accept credit cards, but he hasn't done that yet.

But it gets better. The next year, their son took over the lemonade stand. The daughter moved to another corner and started selling cookies…. That's a whole other story. The son really blew my mind. It occurred to him that he had a lot of traffic. So he talked to a couple of small business owners we go to church with. He convinced the owner of a disaster recovery company to “sponsor” the booth with advertising. So he put their logo on the booth for an extra $200/month for the three months of Summer. And he convinced another company to pay him an additional $200/month for the three months of Summer to set a stack of their flyers (custom designed by him) on the table.

This is still going on every Summer. The oldest is now almost 16 and too busy with college classes to do it anymore. The almost 14 year old son hired his younger sister this last Summer to run things FOR him and he pays her generously. He no longer has to work and pockets about $1000 every month during Summer for doing nothing. He now runs the cookie business as well. Every cup of lemonade gets a coupon for a cookie at half price. Half price for a cookie still quadruples his money just on the cookies.

And now he is considering adding hot chocolate and cookies in Winter. And the lemonade is still free…. But tips are appreciated. Haha!

I keep expecting him to start collecting email addresses and zip codes and to sign up for Square so he can accept credit cards, but he hasn't done that yet.

2. The text of the film must be overtly Christian. Allegory and metaphor are gray areas, but the main themes and plot of the movie must be specifically focused on Christianity as a whole, or elements of Christianity.

3. The message of the film must be overall pro-Christianity, but it must also treat the opposing perspective with enough respect to be compelling.

380,ke6ew9,gaming,Developers are walking on mighty thin ice!,"Watch Dogs, The Division, Ghost Recon, Assassins Creed, Far Cry - Ubisoft titles - that again and again disappoints.
Cyberpunk 2077 - CD Project Red - not even going to comment on this trash.
The Last Of Us Part 2 - Naughty Dogs - jesus!
FIFA - EA Sports - pure robbery!

Unfortunately all types of games that i on paper, would enjoy playing - but unfortunately get robbed by game companies and developers time and time again!

EA Sports (banned) - been playing fifa since the first titles - the unplayable trash they have put on the marked the last 10 years without fixing the issues many people have been complaining about for years - is a joke - + the feeling that you just buy an update at a full games price!

Ubisoft (banned) - all their open world games - feels like the same: boring stories, boring characters, predictable side missions, endless boring cutscenes etc. Repetitive gameplay and animations.
Watch Dogs Legion and AC Valhalla was the final final straw for me....one game could have been a mod of the other. With that comes a history of downgrading graphics for Watch Dogs 1 and Ghost Recon Wildlands - crap AC releases like Unity and Syndicate.

CD Project Red: when gamers makes games? I thought so - the Witcher 3 - was a brilliant game - released ONE MANY PLATFORMS - so i bought into the Cyberpunk hype - just to be f**ked by another game company! While not on my personal banned list yet - i have absolutely no faith or trust in them anymore - and will never pre-order any of their titles again.

Naughty Dogs: while TLOU2 from an technical and visual point of view was outstanding - the story was so thin written - that i really have a hard time understanding, why no one at  Naughty Dogs said: hey do you think people will like Joel to be murdered within the first 10 min of play? And spend most of the game playing as his murderess? Deluded faith in themselves and not their consumers - could be the explanation here. I don't trust Naughty Dogs - and it started with the last Uncharted - where I felt half the game was the ending and very very repetitive gameplay through that last half of the game.
Naughty Dogs was 2013's CD Project Red - ND messed up and lost a lot of trust from me and other gamers.

Who is left? To mainly deliver a good open worldish game?
The only one who haven't hugely disappointed me YET - are Rockstar Games - they might dwell on games with dlcs etc - but have no one's forcing you to get them? But ROCKSTAR GAMES better deliver on GTA6 or i think a lot of people will get fed up with the game industry! 

In general you should never pre-order, buy expansions or dlcs - to put the pressure on the game industry to deliver! Just think if a game had the expansions and dlcs from the start? Wouldn't it be the perfect game?
Would it be unfair to demand? That we actually get what we're paying for? 

The game industry are walking on some MIGHTY THIN ICE these years - of course if you're going to buy their games over and over - no matter if they stole your money in their previous title - then it won't change anything. We gamers need to put more pressure on game developers who keeps throwing trash at us and steal our money - for a project - that was showcased with trailers and demos that have nothing to do with the actual game released! Demo I believe, is a demonstration of a finished product - that you led to believe is not a alpha or a beta version?

387,ke6now,LifeProTips,LPT: Drone Engineering And Why Drones Are Important?," What Is Drone?

 Unmanned, weighs less than 20 kilograms, Any aircraft that emits less noise belongs to the drone category. The drone engineering system is designing from very light sources to increase Maneuvers at very high altitudes. It comprises components such as motors, batteries/fuel, propulsion, and covers (frame).

 The multi-propulsion system is a unique system of a drone. The uniqueness here is that even if one motor in the unit is idle, It has so many motors that it keeps flying. Drones use specialized, powerful batteries because which can fly in the air for a long time. Since drone technology is a complex engineering system, the noise emitted by the drone from the material used for that technology is also very low.

Drone engineering history

 Drone engineering technology was initially was using for military intelligence and special military services. In 1949, unmanned, helium, and hydrogen explosive balloons that struck Venice, Italy, became the first drone engineering technology model. During the Battle of New Chapel in 1915, the British used drone technology to obtain German forts’ images and maps. Later, America developed drone technology. In 1918, as a result, the United States created the Kettering Bug. At the same time, a man named Denny designed the remote-controlled OQ-2 drone.

Therefore, drone engineering technology has undergone a new revolution and is now base on various branches.

401,ke6tox,LifeProTips,"LPT: if you struggle to diet and stay healthy, try making small lifestyle changes that are easier to stick to. It will eventually become habit. Over time you can add to these and eventually you'll have the transformation you was trying to achieve with dieting.","An example of this could be to start having a glass of water with meals. This will ensure you are more hydrated and you'll be drinking water instead of soda or pop.

Or if you take public transport to work you can get off a stop earlier and get on a stop later. This will increase exercise without it feeling like it.

Another example could be to always have a piece of fruit as a mid morning snack. Not only is it nutritional but it will make you less hungry for lunch and will get you in the habit of eating fruit more.

I'm not saying to do these all at once. Just start with 1 and then add to it when it becomes habit. Making huge changes all at once is difficult to maintain and will always feel like a temporary measure until you've lost enough weight.

422,ke7ddi,gaming,We spent the last month building a more fun way to play games. Here's the result,"**TL:DR:**

* Web Platform that allows you to join games (currently only CSGO) in which you have to compete in fun team challenges
* Check it out to give feedback here: [https://challenges.gamebuddy.gg/](https://challenges.gamebuddy.gg/)
* The secret codeword is in the comments

Hey everyone,

have you ever felt the pain when playing competitive games just doesn't feel good sometimes? You're not on top of your game, get frustrated and to wrap it up your teammates are flaming your already tilted self. **Well, we certainly do** and wanted to have a way to still play competitively while having a fun experience.

That's why we came up with our own way to play the game by adding fun team challenges every second round. For every challenge the winning team gets 2 points, winning a CSGO round gives 1 point. In the end, the team with more total points wins. At first, we played the games with having one person observing and doing the referee for challenges but have now managed to check all challenges completely automatically by an algorithm.

We have come up with loads (*33 in total so far*) of different funny challenges, such as

* **Cuddle Challenge**: You're only allowed to move around being very close to all of your teammates
* **No Headshots**: You're not allowed to do a headshot.
* **Headshots only**: Killing without a headshot makes you lose the challenge
* **Best number is 73**: One teammate has to survive with EXACTLY 73 HP
* **Scout Showdown on A**: All players have to meet on A and wait until 01:20 before they are allowed to shoot. You may only use the Scout to do damage
* **Unscoped Sniper Kills only**: You're only allowed to kill others with unscoped sniper shots
* **Race to enemy spawn**: The team that has 1 teammate in the enemy spawn first, wins.
* **Run back to spawn after each kill**: You have to run back to your spawn after each kill. A multikill makes you lose the challenge.
* **Cheapest Kill**: Get a cheaper kill than the enemy team. The price of the killing weapon counts (Knife = 0$)
* **Knife Round**: You may only deal damage using the knife and nades
* **MVP 1v1 on A**: The two best players meet on A for a 1v1. The other teammates have to stay in spawn until the 1v1 is decided.
* **Shotguns only**: You may only deal damage using a shotgun, nades or knife.

Of course, we always try to add new challenges with feedback from all players.

Up until now we always played these matches with teams that we invited, either from the community or even with pros ([see the video to the event here](https://youtu.be/9RAKlgXH6Fg)). But now that we want to give everyone the opportunity to have more fun in CSGO and released a platform for everyone just yesterday.

Currently, the platform is in a very early alpha stage and will allow you to sign in for a match with challenges every day. Once the game starts, the platform shows you how to join it and will show all the challenges + results + standings.

In the future, however, the platform will have more than just that. Soon we will have

* A live matchmaking that queues you up to play instantly at any time you like
* A leaderboard giving you a way to become the best challenge player
* Exclusive events
* A way to qualify for the big events and play for big prize money
* and much more

We know that our platform state is very early, but want to hear everyone's feedback as early as possible to make it as good as possible for everyone and not just ourselves. Feel free to check out the site at [https://challenges.gamebuddy.gg/](https://challenges.gamebuddy.gg/), sign up for a match, and give us feedback on how you liked it. Currently, the platform is invite-only. The codeword to signup is **in the comments**.

If you made it this far reading we're excited to hear what you think. If you have any challenge ideas you'd like to play feel also free to post those.

The next chosen person is some guy who is more or less a Salvation Army volunteer working at a mall. Meanwhile, there's a black guy who happens to be an amateur thief at this same mall. Just as Santa was about to pass his gift, the thief collides into the crowd, and Santa passes the gift to him.

So yeah, it's a black Santa story, and I remember it being pretty wholesome.

438,ke7vxg,xboxone,Xbox Series S game Storage understanding?,"Setting a console up for a family member.

I am trying to limit the amount of games on the Internal SSD as space is not a luxury so I have a 2TB external HDD to account for it and so can swap games in and out.

However, I have some games that when I try and launch from the HDD are saying it needs an upgrade and then downloads the entire game again on the Internal. So my question really is, is there a way to stop it using the Series S version and just play it from the old HDD as a normal Xbox One game or if there is an upgrade I am forced to install it on the Internal to play it?

Second, why is it downloading the game again if it is on the HDD. I feel like there are two versions, is it possible to move the upgraded too and from if I have to use the upgraded.

Old non upgraded games play fine from the HDD and so it is slightly annoying it's forcing me to play an upgraded version of a game I'm not too fussed about being upgraded for the sake of keeping it on the external. Is there a way around this.

Games that force me are Rogue Company and No Mans Sky.
MCC collection is on the HDD but launches from the HDD. It doesnt ask for the upgraded version or to be moved to the internal. I thought this would be the case for all games but I am willing to learn how it all works and why some games wont run from external etc.

479,ke95wv,linux,How to use your phone as a speaker in Linux,"First off, you will need a phone obviously. Mine runs iOS, but Android should work... I think...? Not sure if Android has a firewall enabled. For me, on iOS, I didn't have to mess with any firewalls.

You'll need Pulseaudio on your Linux machine, and you'll need to have ""module-rtp-send"" enabled. For Arch users, to do that just install pulseaudio-rtp.

Okay with that out of the way, **the instructions:**

**Firstly, create a null sink with the name ""rtp"" or whatever:**

    pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=rtp
    
    # Optional - this sets the description for the null sinks
    pacmd 'update-source-proplist rtp.monitor device.description=""Monitor of RTP""'
    pacmd 'update-sink-proplist rtp device.description=""RTP""'

The last two lines just change the name of the null sinks as displayed in pavucontrol. I didn't like seeing ""Null Sink"" and ""Monitor of Null Sink"", as that causes confusion with more complicated setups.

Now you **setup module-rtp-send**, and this time you need the IP address of your phone. For me that's [192.168.100.18](https://192.168.100.18). Obviously you need to have the phone and Linux machine on the same network. Choose an arbitrary port number - I choose 1234:

    pactl load-module module-rtp-send source=rtp.monitor destination_ip=192.168.100.18 port=1234

Note how I used ""rtp.monitor"" as the source. This is because that's the name of the thing, as we used ""sink\_name=rtp"" while creating it. Also note that this ""rtp"" name, and the ""RTP"" description I set earlier are different things.

Now you just redirect any audio you wanna play into the RTP sink. To do that, just open pavucontrol, go to the Playback tab, and change the playback device for the application you want to ""RTP"" (or ""Null Sink"" if you didn't rename it like I did).

**Playing the sound in your phone:**

Open VLC (the mobile app), open the Network tab, click ""Open Network Stream"" and enter ""rtp://@:1234"" (change the port number if you didn't use 1234 in the previous steps). Now you should be able to hear whatever's playing. You can use headphones too.

What's actually happening here is that the Linux machine is sending UDP packets to the IP address specified earlier and the port. UDP is different from TCP - it doesn't have to succeed. This is why you can keep the RTP stream going in the Linux machine, and open and close VLC whenever you want. When you open VLC, it will start listening for UDP packets and pick them up (and play them). This relies on the RTP protocol which uses UDP.

I had to do this because my laptop's headphones are shit, and I do have Apple headphones but it's lightning. But now I can do this to listen to Spotify or whatever on my phone, and the quality is impressive. I did notice a 0.5 to 1 second lag though.

524,keaao1,gaming,Bizarre multi-year problem patching NBA 2K,"I bought three different iterations: NBA 2k17, 2k18, and 2K20. Each version has been installed on at least two different laptops, using different internet networks, and I even created a different Steam account for 2K20 in case my Steam account was the issue. I have changed all the possible factors I could change, but I always get the same bizarre problem. 

Critical folders do not patch, specifically the folders related to saving the game. I have the capacity to make saves for maybe 20 hours of gameplay, and then the capacity gradually whittles away until I can no longer save anything. Saving is really important to this game, especially how I play.

I have been over this with 2K support of the game many times and they cannot figure out why these folders do not patch. I follow all of the instructions they give me and the folders will not install. I have talked with other players of the game, and none of them have ever had this problem or even heard of this problem. Nobody can explain to me why I can't get these folders installed. The only thing remaining would be that I always have the same program installed on every single computer -- even computers that are brand-new and the game is one of the first things I put on the computer -- and that this program is somehow interfering with the installation, some bizarre program that none of the hundreds of thousands of other players have installed.

547,keaw8z,LifeProTips,LPT: How To Never Run Out Of Things To Say In Conversation," We've all been there before — you're in the conversation, things are humming along nicely, and then out of nowhere, the awkward silence rears its head.  

&#x200B;

At that moment, your mind goes completely blank, you don't know what to say, and you can sense the other person's eyes wandering as they look for someone else to talk to. 

&#x200B;

That scenario sucks. So here are 5 tips to make sure that you never run out of things to say in conversation again. 

&#x200B;

## 1. When you find yourself in that situation where your mind has gone blank, play Reminds Me of. 

 

That just means that you look to the environment around you and say, ""You know, that reminds me of..."" and then fill in the blank. It's great for opening new conversational threads and it can also work as a follow-up when someone finishes telling a story which is how many groups of friends interact all the time. 

&#x200B;

That's because people are drawn to others who they feel are similar to themselves and related stories can build that bridge — just be sure NOT to repeatedly make your story superior to theirs or else you can feel like one-upping.

588,kecxkd,gaming,"The use of ""Party Game"" as a genre is flawed.... because it's not a genre","So there's a fundamental problem with how people use the description of ""Party Game""... they're using it as if it's a genre unto itself.

But consider this: many people consider games like You Don't Know Jack, Smash Bros, Sing Star, Rock Band, Mario Kart and Mario Party to be ""party games"".

*However there's a key issue:* Outside of accommodating large amounts of players, usually between 4 to 8.... **those games I listed share very little in common as far as mechanics are concerned**. Being approachable to new players is often the case, but that hardly qualifies as a unique property since **virtually every genre has games with a focus on being approachable** in order to attract more players. Even games like Street Fighter or Guilty Gear have often had developers in interviews that they feel they made their games too difficult to attract people who weren't already fans of the genre or series, and wanted to take steps to remedy that (3 frame buffering, input leniency, one mechanic having multiple functions, etc).

Of course most people use ""Party Game"" to dismiss something as ""not a real x game"" in a genre (the classic debate of **whether or not** **Smash Bros qualifies as a fighting game** has raged for *over two decades).* And that's just the silly, petty elitism that people make fun of gamers for. 

TLDR; Party Game can describe a multiplayer game, but it's not a genre by any stretch. Calling something a party game does not override a game's genre.

604,kede2t,gaming,Too many video games forget they are games.,"Something that I think older developers had a greater grasp on was that video games are, at their core, games.

*Well what does that mean?*

If you do a quick Google search, the definition of ""game"" is "" An activity providing entertainment or amusement; a pastime."" By this definition, what I'm saying doesn't make any sense.

The definition of game I mean, in particular, is this one: ""a physical or mental competition conducted according to rules with the participants in direct opposition to each other.""

I want to clarify that not all video games are traditional competitions. This is self-evident. Almost all video games, though, feature some kind of competitive aspect, whether that be PvP, PvE, or otherwise.

To provide a visual, think of *Call of Duty.* I think that one of the biggest flaws of these games is that the campaign is meant to be *experienced*, not *played*. You can get an equal experience watching TheRadBrad play the COD campaigns as you can playing it. I think the campaigns have some good moments in terms of gameplay, but more often than not, there is almost no incentive to replay the campaigns beyond the narrative.

Not to discredit the narrative, but it shouldn't be prioritized over gameplay. If you wanted to tell that story, cinema is a better medium.

Gameplay is vital, this is well-known. We don't get excited over cinematic trailers anymore. We aren't as easily duped into believing that a narrative can save a game.

An element of gameplay that doesn't receive as much attention as it should is helping the player learn the mechanics. I would argue that players don't just ""learn"" mechanics; they ""solve"" them. Mechanics are puzzle pieces that are used to solve problems through a game. A game like *Minecraft* has a lot of ""puzzle"" mechanics. Crafting is literally a puzzle (at least it was). So what's my point?

Games are fundamentally about problem solving, as far as I can tell. Games that are subpar tend to share some characteristics. The biggest mistake one can make in terms of gameplay is making the system counterintuitive to solving problems within the game, especially in the name of realism. For example, if your game involves fighting across a linear battlefield with long sight lines, but the tactics needed to flush opponents out of cover, grenades), can only be thrown a short distance, then the game quickly becomes frustrating, because there is little one can do to progress. Making problems like this more frustrating to solve makes games unenjoyable.

The example of this kind of mechanic is something that occurred in older versions of *Minecraft*. When drowning, your first instinct is to swim up. However, taking damage used to slow down or knock the player back enough that oftentimes players would be quasi-stunlocked underwater, forced to drown. There was no way to counteract this. While it teaches players to be conscious of their breath, it also disincentivizes going underwater, hence the changes to *Minecraft*'s gameplay come the Ocean update.

I'm not sure how to word this any further, but games have had an identity crisis as of the last decade. Although games like *Doom: Eternal, COD: Black Ops Cold War,* and *Cyberpunk 2077* have largely avoided this, over the past ten years most games trashed the original conventions of their predecessors in favor of more cinematic elements; these elements almost always coming at the expense of gameplay. I'm happy to see the return of more puzzle-like elements, damage indicators, and platforming in modern games. Nintendo didn't fall into this trap, for the most part. Almost all Nintendo games are hyperaware of what they are, a video game. I'm not a Nintendo guy, but I can't help but respect Nintendo for their commitment to video games (not community tho lol). I'm glad to see *Doom: Eternal* and *Titanfall 2* be praised so much for their gameplay, and almost all of it is because both of them have such great understanding of what they are. Valve also has a great understanding of this. Unfortunately, many Triple A games have struggled with this, although I sense a change.

As a final remark, seeing the hatred for *Halo: Infinite*'s gameplay reveal was disheartening. Ultimately, I liked the reveal, not because the game looked graphically polished, it wasn't, but because the game looks *fun* because it seems to have embraced the parts of *Halo*'s gameplay that embraced its video game status. Especially the expansion of the sandbox for more ways to solve problems in the game. I'm very excited because I believe *Infinite* will be a great game, even if people discard it for petty reasons.

Also, please make better tutorials, game developers. I have ADHD, reading blocks of instructions do not teach me how the mechanics of your game are used.

619,kedqry,gaming,Can anyone suggest a good First Person Shooter with the ability to choose a server?,"I used to play the older Call of Duty quite a bit, and there was a very active community of players on a particular server, where we liked to talk to each other, either via the mike or the text chat feature. Sadly, I've yet to experience something like that again in more recent times. 

I think the problem is the auto-match-making function present in most games today. It seems that most games pick a server for you based on skill level and ping. That functionality does have a reason to exist and I'm not saying games shouldn't do that at all, but it also means you can't frequent a server that generally has friendly people on it, a server that has more strict rules against bullying or spawn camping, or one that is more technically reliable. 

More often than not I end up on a server where literally not even one person uses the text chat or the mike.

625,kedw3g,LifeProTips,LPT: Modern automobiles DO NOT need to be warmed up before driving in cold weather.,"I've tried to explain this to people in my life, to no avail. So hopefully, I can at least help some of you out. 

There's a long lasting belief that, in cold weather, your vehicle need to idle a bit before driving, in order for the oil to heat properly. Modern synthetic oil is designed to work in cold and warm temperatures. (Just make sure you are using the correct oil for your car.)

This myth does have some truth. Before the early 80's, most cars/trucks had carburetors, which DID need to warm a bit to work properly. However, the car makers did away with carburetors in favor of electronic fuel injection which uses sensors to supply fuel to the engine and get the right air and fuel mix**.** That eliminated the need to warm the vehicle, because the sensors monitor and adjust to temperature conditions. 

This does NOT apply to people that like to warm it up to dethaw frost or ice, make wiping snow off easier, or just so it's warm when you get in. (Idling is still not good for the environment, no matter the reason.)",I try explain people life avail So hopefully I least help There long lasting belief cold weather vehicle need idle bit drive order oil heat properly Modern synthetic oil design work cold warm temperature Just make sure use correct oil car This myth truth Before early carburetor DID need warm bit work properly However car maker away carburetor favor electronic fuel injection use sensor supply fuel engine get right air fuel mix That eliminate need warm vehicle sensor monitor adjust temperature condition This NOT apply people like warm dethaw frost ice make wipe snow easy warm get Idling still good environment matter reason

This is a good thing though. Bugs can be identified and patched way quicker than if the entire studio just played the game over and over again to find random bugs. It gives players an opportunity to give feedback on potential features they’d like.

650,keedgb,xboxone,Question about saves in Mass Effect and Xbox Game Pass.,"Hello people, 

So here's the rundown: Currently, I'm subscribed to Xbox Game Pass because I used it to play Jedi Fallen Order as well as a few other games. I'm now looking at the Mass Effect trilogy on Game Pass because I never played ME 2 or 3, but the thing is, a friend is also giving me his collection of all three ME games for Christmas because he won't ever play them again. I'll be honest, I'm kind of done with Game Pass and Mass Effect was the only reason I was gonna stay subscribed, but since I'm getting the games for free, why should I? 

But here's the rub: I'm bored as hell and absolutely ITCHING to play Mass Effect. Like yesterday. I don't think I can wait until Christmas to begin my galactic journey. So here's my question: if I start a save on the Game Pass version of Mass Effect and then later unsubscribe from the service and use my own disk for the game, will my data carry over and I can just pick up where I left off? Or will unsubscribing from Game Pass delete my save? In other words: how are my saves stored with Game Pass? Are they somehow saved with the subscription or on my Xbox? 

Side question: you use saves from Mass Effect 1 to decide things about Mass Effect 2 and onwards. Choices you make in the first game are carried over to the later ones. How would that work with Game Pass?

659,keemj1,cyberpunkgame,"Finished Main Story, and most side quests- pros & cons as I see them.","This will include spoilers. 

Pros- richly immersive city, fantastic set design in general, fun to explore, interesting, unusual and beautiful even in its ugliness to behold.  Really appreciating the design of this vast playground, with partially destructible environments, fast travel options, lots of interiors to explore as well, and significant verticality in design, as in being able to jump around on rooftops a bit. 

Minor Downside- parkour and city exploration of a sort has been done and well in other games, and while CP is decent, it falls short in the extremity of it.  Ie- no Dying Light parkour.  No Assassins Creed climbing.  No Spider-Man type of travel.   Night City is fairly well realized, but it can be a bit of a chore to navigate.  

Pros- lots of customization options, including character appearance, life paths, choices in convos leading to multiple endings.   Also, quite a few options for vehicles, weapons, clothing, cyberware.  Have to acknowledge the work that went into this level of detail in window dressing, immersion & role playing.  

Cons- people will never be satisfied until you give them all the tools to create what they like in a way which feels natural to them.    Clothing and weapon options always seemed like I was just making do with the best stuff I could find lying about.   I didn’t get much money if any for a lot of jobs, and the high end cars and cyberware were all over 100k, well out of my price range.   I also put a lot of points into tech to create legendary items, and the crafting felt like a chore.   I haven’t explored probably a lot of this game, which encourages multiple playthroughs, but it wasn’t clear to me how to get enough money for what I wanted, how to level my character and tweak their performance to my liking, and crafting should be optimized as well (like a button to make 50 of something, particularly upgrading components). 

The gameplay loop felt a little anemic after a while too, as it has for me in other massive AAA games like RDR2.   The story is what keeps people going. The gameplay loop otherwise is just stealing and killing, and driving cars. 

The problem with the beautifully acted, scripted and voiced NPCS, which possess an admirable aesthetic and level of detail, is that talking to them is very time consuming.  The whole thing, including travel time and unskippable cut scenes is almost like being inside a first person choose your own adventure movie where all you do is shoot, hack, drive, fight, and play with virtual dolls.  

So, for me, the game looks and sounds great, but is a bit clunky in some regards.  Definitely worth playing- but i will have to see if the replay value is as high as it’s made out to be.   

Every article I’ve been seeing is whining about the bugginess, the marketing strategy, the ‘shallowness’ and what they personally find offensive about the game.  I do not think for a second that a game company should try to publish something catering to SJWs, but I do think more time and money could have been better spent in customization, depth, fun factor and thorough play testing.

The 300lb. engine spins up to 26,000 RPM (idle is 13,000 RPM), draws air at 11,000 CFM, and is rated at 1350 hp. The structure holding the engine was designed using finite element analysis and is redundant. Strong, damage tolerant, and light. The force from the jet is harnessed using sandwich plates bolted to contoured aluminum billets inserted into the frame rails. The engine has rigid mounts with rubber bushings in the front and the back are sliding. It grows as it warms up so the engine mounts have to account for this. The interior was finished in the original color with two-stage PPG paint. A heat blanket keeps the plastic bumper from melting when the jet is operating.",The engine General Electric Model internal modification custom tailpipe The engine spin RPM idle RPM draw air CFM rat hp The structure hold engine design use finite element analysis redundant Strong damage tolerant light The force jet harness use sandwich plate bolt contoured aluminum billet insert frame rail The engine rigid mount rubber bushing front back slide It grow warms engine mount account The interior finish original color PPG paint A heat blanket keep plastic bumper melt jet operating

663,keemqh,cyberpunkgame,"The ""Stronger Together"" and ""Transporter"" Perks Should Also Apply to Grappled Enemies","Title.

As it is now, ""grappling"" and related skills/perks are oddly implemented; while Stronger Together and Transporter by themselves seem to encourage the rather odd playstyle of lugging around a dead/unconscious friend since there is rarely an organic reason for your to be carrying a body and needing to shoot someone.

First we have the Body attribute which reduces your movement penalty while grappling an enemy, increases your movement speed while grappling an enemy, and increases how long you can grapple an enemy. All of those buffs seem rather pointless when you have little to no reason to pull an enemy around instead of just finishing them off and moving their body.

The ""Human Shield"" perk in Athletics gives you additional armor while grappling an enemy, but again, why? You have zero reason to lumber around with a grappled enemy, especially in the middle of combat.

""Stunning Blows"" in the Stealth tree gives you the opportunity to stun an enemy, letting you grapple them, when you quick melee with a gun. While this has the application of letting you use a takedown on an enemy mid-combat, it begs the question of why didn't you just shoot them or use an actual melee weapon? Both of those options would likely kill them just as fast and not lock you into animations. It would also *seem* like this was meant to be paired with Human Shield to quickly grab an enemy mid combat for protection, but doing so leaves you with no offensive options and your only defense being to awkwardly try to shuffle behind cover.

Changing Transporter(fire pistols/revolvers while carrying a body) and Stronger Together(Increase damage while carrying a body) to also work while grappling an enemy would improve all of the above skills. With that change, you could then enter combat, use Stunning Blow to stun an enemy close to you, grab them, gain a bonus to your armor and damage thanks to Human Shield and Stronger Together, start shooting with Transporter, and with your investment into Body have improved speed and a decent amount of time before your shield buddy breaks free or you need to finish them off.",Title As grapple relate oddly implement Stronger Together Transporter seem encourage rather odd playstyle lug around friend since rarely organic reason carry body need shoot someone First Body attribute reduces movement penalty grapple enemy increase movement speed grapple enemy increase long grapple enemy All buff seem rather pointless little reason pull enemy around instead finish move body The Human Shield perk Athletics give additional armor grapple enemy You zero reason lumber around grapple enemy especially middle combat Stunning Blows Stealth tree give opportunity stun enemy let grapple quick melee gun While application let use takedown enemy begs question shoot use actual melee weapon Both option would likely kill fast lock animation It would also seem like meant pair Human Shield quickly grab enemy mid combat protection leave offensive option defense awkwardly try shuffle behind cover Changing Transporter fire carry body Stronger Together Increase damage carry body also work grapple enemy would improve skill With change could enter combat use Stunning Blow stun enemy close grab gain bonus armor damage thanks Human Shield Stronger Together start shoot Transporter investment Body improve speed decent amount time shield buddy break free need finish

The English version, the one that most of people will see states that you can ""opt to refund your copy"". To opt... implies that it is an available choice, like it's guaranteed. Choose to get a refund, or not.

First I thought that they were being maliciously deceptive again... now I think that they're being stupid and made a silly mistake while translating their ""apology"", which led millions of people to believe they would be granted refunds upon request.

By the way, how naïve are people defending them ? Saying that they're cool after all because they apologized ? What else could they have done ? It's a PR play, the only one that makes sense at this point. It is damage control, to keep as much money as they can. It is not motivated by a need to regain their reputation (good luck with that), it is motivated by money, as was the initial attempt at pulling off the biggest scam in gaming history.

675,keephk,cyberpunkgame,Item transmogrification station or vendor to transform item appearance.,"I know pitching an improvement idea is a bit hopeful know there is much to be altered and  expanded on in coming updates. 

But here goes!.

Item transmogrification. I posted before about the lootable clothing items not being quite that good.

There are some i really like, like the half face gas mask and samurai style paramilitary helmet combo. And yes i can grind and keep upgrading this specific piece. But i will and do find better alternatives stat wise and roll wise. 

The problem is some of those items are just not appealing in the looks department. 

I would love to ""eventually"" see a system official, or modded. That when you loot an item of clothing the design, style of the item becomes available at a transmog station for a cost. 

If you could use crafting components to pay to re-roll certain stats that would also be cool. But its maintaining a style of character that i am most interested in personally. 

When i loot a part of awesome combat trousers, i really don't wanna move to that pair of short shorts because it somehow gives me a massive boost to armour. 

Something akin to the Diablo transmog station. 

I will absolutely grind the components to keep upgrading my equipment i like. But having the option to pay in some form of ingame credits or credits/crafting components to transform the item appearance would go a long way to investing me further in creating the Cyberpunk i want to be. 

I don't know if people will agree with this or not.

Hello,
I want to first off state I currently own a gaming rig and also just got a laptop on a open box deal for 1300$ (Surface Book 3 “15 inch with 1660ti max q). I have owned 2 gaming laptops in the past but after purchasing never really used due to the fact it was 17 inch and super big laptop. It also got extremely hot (Hp Omen X 17 with 1080).

So question should I keep laptop I currently have? I really do like the tablet laptop aspect and also having the 4K display, nice keyboard and excellent build quality. Best webcam on laptop I have ever seen etc. But since I am spending 1300 I feel I could find another open box deal on something of equivalent quality for the price. Zephyrus and Blade 15 both in 4K quality. For around 1200-1300 open box. Should I keep or get something else?

705,kef9pv,gaming,For years my dream has been to create my own videogame," For years my dream has been to create my own videogame.

Back when I was 10 I would mess around with GameMaker and Pokemon hackrom tools to create my own little universe, but I never finished any game. I would always feel like I didn't have the knowledge to create a good, worth game.

Ten months ago the same idea of creating a game came to my mind. So I started putting ideas together, hiring a little indie team... and finally made my dream come true!

Now we still have to get the Kickstarter funded, and I'm afraid we won't make it, but even if we don't make it, I'm glad I've managed to create this little demo for myself!

710,kefccb,gaming,What should our expectations for games be?,"I recently found myself in a debate with someone over what our expectations for game studios should be and how their output should affect those expectations. IMO we should always have high expectations for a game regardless of how precious games by the same studio have been. Take CDPR, we had high expectations for CP2077 because of The Witcher 3 but the developers/studio have obviously failed to deliver to the level that the bar we set was at. This of course will lead to many people having low expectations for CDPR’s next game whatever that may be however I don’t think that is the correct way to go about doing things, if we have low expectations for a game that means the bar is low and developers only have to deliver a game made to a low standard, this means that if they exceed the low standard, reviewers and gamers alike will be impressed by what could by all means be little more than a mediocre game. In this way we reward game studios by having low expectations for their games and in my opinion the last thing that we should do is reward game studios for putting out bad games. 

NB: I should clear up that I understand that developers probably want to make a game to the best of their ability regardless of the expectations for the game that they are making, however when I say studios I mean the guys at the corporate level who see the games as little more than monetary gain and don’t care about the art in the games.",I recently find debate someone expectation game studio output affect expectation IMO always high expectation game regardless precious game studio Take CDPR high expectation The Witcher obviously fail deliver level bar set This course lead many people low expectation CDPRs next game whatever may however I dont think correct way go thing low expectation game mean bar low developer deliver game make low standard mean exceed low standard reviewer gamers alike impress could mean little mediocre game In way reward game studio low expectation game opinion last thing reward game studios put bad game NB I clear I understand developer probably want make game best ability regardless expectation game make however I say studio I mean guys corporate level see game little monetary gain dont care art game

712,kefgjc,LifeProTips,"LPT - Winter is coming. Don’t cheap out on anything that comes between you and the ground, like shoes, socks, car tires, carpet, a chair, or a mattress. You will absolutely live to regret it.","Story time! 

When I first started my career in nursing, I didn’t buy the best shoes like I should have, because I was being cheap even though I didn’t need to be. Fast forward a few months, and I had plantar fasciitis so bad that I needed surgery. Cost me months of my career. 

I learned my lesson the hard way so you all don’t have to. Be nice to yourself if something touches the ground. You can *easily* injure yourself over time otherwise. Sleep problems? It’s probably your mattress. Buy something better and be nice to your spine. Foot problems? Go see an orthopedist and get a shoe prescription; a lot of health insurance covers it these days. Tail bone hurt when you sit? It’s probably your chair. Get something better. 

And for the love of all things, with winter here make sure your tires aren’t ass and check to see if you live near any free air spots. In my part of the country we have a convenience store called Wawa; the gas station versions all have free air. Get some good tires and keep them at 32+ psi. It could legitimately save your life in crappy weather, and we’re getting a lot of it this year. Some of the wild animals near me all started growing their winter coats months early, which typically means a *bad* winter. Don’t go driving in that garbage with bad tires. Paying more for a better product is worth staying alive.

I think it sucks. Unlike most I disliked it from the beginning (not starting with TLJ or TROS). TFA was such a cheap nostalgia bait movie. Its basically guaranteed the other two movies wouldn't be good.

It basically reset the galaxy to how it was at the beginning of A New Hope. Instead of moving forward we just have new versions of Rebels vs the Empire + a ""bigger"" Death Star with Starkiller Base. Everything the OT heroes did, didn't matter.

TLJ continued this but then added some twists for the sake of it and didn't set up the next movie (killing off Snoke for an example). Luke was portrayed horribly, no surprise Mark Hamill called him ""Jake"" Skywalker.

TROS is probably the worst. When I first heard Palpatine was back I thought people were joking, it felt like bad fanfiction straight out of some poorly received Legends Book.

The characters of the ST were all weak. Finn is so wasted even his actor is pissed. Rey is just bland, feels like she is just there to redo Luke's story but she doesn't stand on her own..its clear they didn't even know her origins. Kylo Ren is probably the most fleshed out one but still felt rehashed with his redemption.

742,keg0w6,movies,"Enough is enough, Die Hard Is Not a Christmas Movie!!!","I never wanted to write this essay. This debate has come up every year recently, and I hate it because it is just a cacophony of wrongness that drives me bananas. I wasn’t going to weigh in on it officially, but I realized it would be efficient to have all my reasoning compiled in a single location so that in the future I can save time by just pointing people to this article and thereby not have to discuss it any further. Is *Die Hard* a Christmas movie? 

**No, it is not.**

Let’s start by acknowledging that there are two ways to become a Christmas movie—and *Die Hard* does probably qualify under one of them. The two ways use different, non-overlapping evidence. That first way is by tradition and association. 

Anything can become a Christmas movie if it’s by tradition. *Predator* could be a Christmas movie if it became a tradition to watch it during the season. It is arguable that enough people have made it a holiday tradition to watch the movie this time of year that *Die Hard* is a Christmas movie by this method. Evidence such as seeing the DVD on sale at Target in the “Xmas movies” section, or the movie playing during a TNT “Christmas movie marathon,” would fall here, because becoming a movie this way says nothing about the actual movie itself, only about people’s perceptions of it. Many people may associate *Die Hard* with Christmas, but that does not make it a Christmas movie.

If *Predator* came to be popularly associated with Christmas, it would also be sold by Target and played by TNT in the same way, because companies are just looking to market to people, ride trends, and make as much money as possible. If companies hear a movie is being associated with a holiday by any meaningful metric, they will sell it next to that holiday. It says nothing about the movie itself. 

This brings up the inherent unfairness of the association factor, which is that just by engaging in this conversation, opponents of the *Die Hard* theory—like me—reinforce the connection because we keep putting “*Die Hard”* and “Christmas” next to each other in sentences. The more I argue about this, the longer this argument goes on, the more I lose because it just builds the status of the other side.

I reject this method of being a Christmas movie, however, because this isn’t what the “yeses” truly mean when they say *Die Hard* is a Christmas movie. The true controversy is over the second way to be a Christmas film: **it's content**. 

Only the content of the film actually matters in this discussion; it is the only truly relevant evidence. In saying that, I will take a digression to dispense with another form of evidence: artist intent. I subscribe, more or less, to the “death of the author*”* theory: An artist’s intention when making a work of art can be taken as informative, but it is not dispositive. Once a piece is out in the world, it stands on its own.

Even taking the artist's intent into account, what do we have? Much has been made of the fact that the writer of *Die Hard*, Steven E. de Souza, has gone on record to say he believes it *is* a Christmas movie. The thing about that is though: he’s just the writer. Movies are collaborative projects that require the input of dozens, if not hundreds, of people to come to life, and some input matters more than others. Within that hierarchy, the writer ranks very low. The joke is that the blonde goes to Hollywood and sleeps with the writer. It’s also a truism that film is fundamentally a director’s medium (whereas theater best showcases actors and television writers). All which is to say, of all the possible people to have on your side in this debate, you come at me backed up by the *writer*? 

Ultimately, of course, it wouldn’t matter if the writer, director, stars, and craft services all released a public statement formally declaring *Die Hard* a Christmas film because the intent of the artist is not dispositive; it is merely informative. The only conclusive evidence lies within the four corners of the work of art. All that matters is the movie itself.

*Die Hard* is an action movie, with Christmas elements sprinkled in. None of these Christmas elements are essential to the film. Every one of them could be removed, or replaced, and the movie would still work. Not only would it still work, but it would also be nearly unchanged. 

Compare *Die Hard* to an actual Christmas movie: *The Santa Clause*. In *The Santa Clause*, the entire film, nearly every scene, relies on Christmas or something Christmas-related as a premise. In *Die Hard*, what is there? A handful of jokes. A couple of songs. The biggest element is the fact that the attack takes place during an office Christmas party, but this could be replaced with anything. It could be a New Year’s party, a Super Bowl party, a party celebrating a merger, the Christmas part is irrelevant. It’s a setting; not a genre. 

*Die Hard* could take place during the company’s non-denominational office holiday party. It doesn’t have to be Christmas; it would still work fine. But apply that same logic to *Elf*, and the movie doesn’t work. That’s why *Elf* is a Christmas movie, and *Die Hard* isn’t.

*Die Hard* is not a Christmas movie because it’s not about Christmas; it just takes place during it. It’s more like *The Karate Kid*. There is a scene in *The Karate Kid* that takes place over Halloween. Would you call *The Karate Kid* a Halloween movie? 

Here’s a thought experiment. Imagine an alien came to Earth and said, “teach me what a Christmas movie is.” Would you show the alien *Die Hard*? After seeing only *Die Hard*, would the alien be able to turn around and produce a Christmas movie? If you told the alien all the hallmarks of a Christmas movie and then showed it *Die Hard*, would the alien be confused? 

One weak-as-hell argument I’ve heard is that *Die Hard* has “Christmas themes.” Namely, over the course of the film, John McClane rekindles his relationship with his estranged wife, Holly. This isn’t a Christmas theme. It’s an action movie theme. Action and adventure movies constantly feature the reunion of estranged people and families. It’s a trope. Think of *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. Think of *Terminator 2*. *Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade*. *The River Wild*. *The Incredibles*, *Indiana Jones and The Crystal Skull*, *True Lies*. And saving a relationship is just a mild spin on forming a relationship, which adds a whole new crop of action movies to list, not least of which being “Die Hard on a bus,” *Speed*. Even in the *Die Hard* series, John McClane reunites with every other estranged member of his family, in sequels that don’t take place on Christmas.

When all is said and done, it comes down to an analogy. Imagine the movie is a Jenga tower. If you pull out all the Christmas stuff, does it remain standing? Take all the Christmas out of *Miracle on 34th Street* and it would topple. Pull the Christmas from *Jingle All The Way*, it falls. If you take the Christmas out of *Die Hard*, it would remain standing. The reason is because it is not a Christmas movie. It’s an action movie with some Christmas seasoning. The Christmas stuff, it’s just gravy. The action is the meal. 

*Die Hard* is an action movie with some Christmas tinsel on it. But a little bit of tinsel does not make you a Christmas tree.

Get over it.

775,keh7sh,gaming,Looking for a Battle Royale game that is similar to how Fortnite was in the beginning,"Hi!

I used to play a lot of Fortnite - never been great at it, but I loved the concept of the game. Lately I've found it hard to keep up with all the Marvel-based content they have been releasing, as I'm admittedly not a Marvel fan, but on top of that it feels like there is so much to get done in one season that I don't know where to begin, and I'm honestly not interested in the game anymore as it feels so clogged up with promotional skins and stuff, I feel like it's kind of lost what made it so awesome in the beginning.

I was hoping there is a more 'simple' Battle Royale game out there for me, kind of how Fortnite used to be where you had simple tasks to complete, without necessarily needing to keep up with the story.

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

830,keixk0,cars,ELI5 - Automatics behaving briefly like a CVT (increase in speed while revs stay consistent),"Hi all, question here and don't know how else to ask without explaining (sorry for the dumb post title).

I'm wondering what's happening when my automatic car seems to hold a gear at a steady RPM while at the same time accelerating. For a brief period of time, the automatic seems to be working like a CVT. Rather than speed increasing in conjunction with the RPMs increasing in whatever gear, the car shifts to a different gear, seems to hold the engine at 3K (example) while speeds increase from 20-35 MPH (also example). Eventually it hits a point where the RPMs start to rise with speed until the next shift. But there is a period time that I always think ""is this what it's like to drive a CVT?""

My current car is a Honda Accord with the 2.0T engine and 10 speed automatic. It doesn't happen all the time, and it's happened in every automatic transmission vehicle i've ever driven. I think it's more circumstantial (low speeds, accelerating, and a shift just happening but those are just guesses based on the last time I remember this happening) vs something that happens all the time. I wouldn't describe the shifts as ""hard"" or even slipping, but I know nothing.  

Can anyone explain what's happening here? I've done my own Googling and can't figure it out. Something to do with the torque converter?

In CP 2077 however, you'll either get a briefing by only a handful of fixers or you can choose to go directly to markers, only to find out halfway through the quest that you weren't looking to get into another 10 minute factory shootout and pickup-item quest. There doesn't seem to be traditional emerging quests, where NPCs simply approach you, or flag you down, or drag (and captivate) you into their storyline one way or another.

853,km2apy,movies,"This past weekend, I watched Die Hard 2 and 3 for the first time. Not sure which is better but DH2 doesn’t seem to get the credit it deserves.","A few years back I watched Die Hard for the first time during Christmas week. For some reason I put off watching the rest of the series until this past weekend. I have HBO Max so I watched Die Hard for Christmas then the following 2 the next 2 days. 

I read and watched reviews and rankings about this series without spoilers. It seems like Die Hard 2 is usually the least preferred of the trilogy. It also seems like DH2 is often only ranked above Die Hard 5, which is universally known to be the worst. I read somewhere that the trilogy was the actual Die Hard series with Die Hard 4 and 5 being Bruce Willis action movies that happened to be titled Die Hard. 

After watching the trilogy, DH1 is still the best and my favorite, but I’m not sure I’ll join the popular opinion that Die Hard 3 is better than DH2. First, what DH3 does better is that it has a better villain who gets a great [soundtrack bit](https://youtu.be/x8Rj7x4_zRo) (though DH2’s villain was good enough), doesn’t have an annoying asshole cop/G man that opposes McClane the whole time (Lorenzo in Die Hard 2 was so annoying), Zeus was a great addition as a fellow main protagonist, and in general, DH3 shakes up the formula more. 

A lot of people not only rank DH2 towards the bottom of the series but also think it’s just a mediocre action flick. I still like DH2 a lot as an action film and think it’s great. It might be too similar to DH1 for some, but I appreciate the continuity. It feels more like a continuation than DH3 does. Like DH1, DH2 is also Christmas themed, takes place mostly at night, and brings back several characters who are in similar roles (I liked that Powell was back but disliked how he was barely in it). DH3 is good but seems a lot different from the first 2, taking place mostly in daylight, it’s not Christmas themed, and no one except McClane returns. I know the differences are what they were going for though. DH3 also has a more abrupt final battle and ending. Not as satisfying as DH2’s imo. And is it just me, or does DH3 have the least amount of McClane screen time of the trilogy? 

Perhaps DH2 is too similar to DH1, even down to using the same Christmas song at the very end, but there are enough differences to be valued. 

Now for it not getting enough credit. Well, it was released only 2 years after DH1, so it’s surprising that it’s even as good and big as it is. This year was its 30th anniversary, and unless I missed it, I didn’t really see a whole lot of attention brought to it like DH1 had for its 30th anniversary 2 years ago. DH2 is the only other Christmas film of the series, yet it doesn’t really seem to get the attention most other Christmas films get during the season.

Was/is DH2 viewed as too dark and bleak? Admittedly, it’s the darkest and bleakest of the three films. The villains are the most evil and brutal of the series, and that is shown through the people they kill.",A year back I watch Die Hard first time Christmas week For reason I put watch rest series past weekend I HBO Max I watch Die Hard Christmas follow next day I read watched review ranking series without spoiler It seem like Die Hard usually least preferred trilogy It also seem like often rank Die Hard universally know bad I read somewhere trilogy actual Die Hard series Die Hard Bruce Willis action movie happen title Die Hard After watch trilogy still best favorite Im sure Ill join popular opinion Die Hard good First well well villain get great soundtrack bit though villain good enough doesnt annoy asshole man oppose McClane whole time Lorenzo Die Hard annoy Zeus great addition fellow main protagonist general shake formula A lot people rank towards bottom series also think mediocre action flick I still like lot action film think great It might similar I appreciate continuity It feel like continuation Like also Christmas theme take place mostly night bring back several character similar role I like Powell back dislike barely good seem lot different first take place mostly daylight Christmas theme one except McClane return I know difference go though also abrupt final battle end Not satisfy imo And least amount McClane screen time trilogy Perhaps similar even use Christmas song end enough difference value Now get enough credit Well release year surprise even good big This year anniversary unless I miss I didnt really see whole lot attention bring like anniversary year ago Christmas film series yet doesnt really seem get attention Christmas film get season view dark bleak Admittedly dark bleak three film The villain evil brutal series show people kill

Thankfully I made a save outside the door to embers BEFORE going in, but seems pretty fucking shit that I have to reload that save and can’t just “carry on” from the end of the final mission/epilogue.

Anyone else had this issue? And for the life of me that fucking space ending is the worst one in the whole game, just sitting in a fucking chair repeating the same shit for nearly 30 odd minutes.

870,kntpa4,movies,"Funny Games, Michael Haneke 1997","While I wouldn't say it's Hanekes best, Funny Games is perhaps his most memorable and iconic. Something really interesting tends to happen when these established art-house directors like Claire Denis or Lynn Ramsey use genre to explore their themes - often subverting or at least adapting its tropes to suit their artistic agenda. Too me a least, this is home invasion at its most uncomfortable and horrifying - and Haneke had very specific ideas about how character function in the narrative. Taking a humanist approach, he avoids easy explanations of degenerate behavior by use of xenophobic othering or fears of the lower class - Peter and Paul even mock these types of ideas in the film.

Fourth wall breaking has a very interesting function as well - making it clear that the violence and injustice is as much aimed at us as spectators as the family itself. Our expectations are upended, and the narrative twists cruelly to prove Hanekes point - we are subject to media and its manipulations. But this is also his most mischievous and funny film. It isn't just Arno Frisch's character but also Haneke winking at us - and its a good reminder that while he is typically thought of as very seriously minded, even a little cold and calculated, a sense of humor can be spotted in how he relates to us as viewers. There is an element of glee in how things go bad, and the hurdles his character go through.

I really like how he uses violence - its direct, impactful and has consequence. Characters are properly vulnerable, which increases our sense of unease. But he also uses the violence of language and demonstrates what power name-calling and condescension has over a persons sense of self.

What are you're thoughts on the film?

Take the time now to be sure your pets (reactive or not) have a safe space during the upcoming fireworks and that  they can’t get outside.

What's stopping the rocket scientists on the Windows side from making such a clone migration as stupidly easy? Surely it's got to be possible by now?

I'm just settling into the thought of migrating a Windows work machine for the first time in probably 15+  years; I'd been on Linux and Mac laptops for that long, until the last three years back on a Windows laptop. I'm already resigned to having to side-by-side the machines for some time as I find and reinstall anything I use application-wise, cloning various values that I fine tuned... making sure my cheese is in the right place... 

...and lusting for just jamming two Macbooks together at bedtime, pressing go, and waking up to a finished migration....",I Windows long shit I Apple various Unixes Linuxes long For unaware migrate example Macbooks simple tether hit next day old slow laptop clone whole new laptop application setting level You basically copy new OS hardware container I know Windows much big ecosystem foundational underlying difference I know thing like Linux subsystems kernel well I pretend even slightly know Windows side well I never professionally work Windows sometimes side thing work laptop I live generally nix world What stop rocket scientist Windows side make clone migration stupidly easy Surely get possible I settle think migrate Windows work machine first time probably year I Linux Mac laptops long last three year back Windows laptop I already resign machine time I find reinstall anything I use clone various value I fine tune make sure cheese right place lust jam two Macbooks together bedtime press go wake finish migration

901,ko04x4,gaming,"A few questions about Hades, I feel it may be a very good purchase for me, I'm just not sure.","First off, I'm a pretty casual gamer, and I'm not exactly good. Is Hades tedious in a way BOTW is? In BOTW, the weapons breaking and the goddamn shrines just feel like a chore. Also, is it somewhat similar to Rocket League? Even if I lose in rocket league, I keep coming back to it and can play in short or long spurts. Will Hades just make me play for about ten minutes then stop, or keep my brain calm enough to keep playing it again and again? Just to clarify, no, I did not like BOTW. Is the battle gameplay simple, like is it super quick to beat most enemies, and do they follow me? Does the game get way easier with each run, and can you save at any time? If I somehow beat the game in one run, how long does a single run take(I know impossible). Finally, for a  new gamer( I've had my switch for about a year and a half, and I've never gamed before that), how many runs should I expect to need to beat the game? I'm sorry for asking so many questions, it's just that a few games I've purchased(all triple-a titles)didn't click for me. Thanks!",First I pretty casual gamer I exactly good Is Hades tedious way BOTW In BOTW weapon break goddamn shrine feel like chore Also somewhat similar Rocket League Even I lose rocket league I keep come back play short long spurt Will Hades make play ten minute stop keep brain calm enough keep playing Just clarify I like BOTW Is battle gameplay simple like super quick beat enemy follow Does game get way easy run save time If I somehow beat game one run long single run take I know impossible Finally new gamer I switch year half I never game many run I expect need beat game I sorry ask many question game I purchase title click Thanks
