6,"Gamergate in 2014-2016 was a movement that started out truly impassioned but in the eyes of many, including those who started out as it's leaders on YT and elsewhere, became more about sensationalism and adapting the tactics of the faux social justice and progressive side they were battling.  Hence why we've seen all the YT channels that were part of this in 2014-2016 leave the movement entirely and/or fall off the radar.

&#x200B;

Now, with a revived GamerGate movement alognside Comics Gate and Fandom Menace, the battle is coming back and there is indeed a sort of GamerGate 2.0.

&#x200B;

And there's an abundance of channels joining in this time, perhaps more than last time.  There's Nerdrotic, Clownfish TV, Critical Drinker, Geeks and Gamers, That Star Wars Girl, Heelvsbabyface, Midnight's Edge, YoungRippa59, WorldClassBullshitters, Yellowflash2, Mauler, Robot Head, Cecil, Ethan Van Sciver and Drunk3PO.  Almost all the channels listed have 6 figure subscriber accounts, meaning the support is definitely there.

&#x200B;

Do you feel this movement is effective in picking up where the first wave left off or are they too stuck in 2014 -2016?

&#x200B;

80,"This idea popped into my head a couple of times during the past few days playing Far Cry. I've been thinking how we all are used to playing games in a series and their familiar mechanics carrying over and whatnot, but most of the time the only major change is the setting. 

With something like Far Cry, I was thinking over how I first got into the series with 2 and while it's not everyone's favorite, it still has it's fans for the 'survival' mechanics like weapon degradation, limited map system, and weather effects. Since then, I've always wondered why Ubisoft never tried making more Far Cry games with this system. I'm sure a majority of people still prefer the other games like 3-5, but something about 2 just made me think about all the unused potential that a survival-esque FPS like that can be both challenging and engaging.

That's my two cents, feel free to tell me what series or games you would change back or add to their formula.",KotakuInAction,This idea pop head couple time past day play Far Cry I think use play game series familiar mechanic carry whatnot time major change set With something like Far Cry I think I first get series everyone favorite still fan mechanic like weapon degradation limit map system weather effect Since I always wonder Ubisoft never try make Far Cry game system I sure majority people still prefer game like something make think unused potential FPS like challenge engage That two cent feel free tell series game would change back add formula
95,"OK, not sure if this really belongs here, but I think it does since I will be addressing the influence of pop culture ""critics"" and ""journalists"" and ""progressive"" culture. Middle part is me ranting about with examples, feel free to skip to the conclusion if you want.

Also **SPOILER WARNING** for the following games: Cyberpunk 2077 (I will spoiler tag that section for those who want to read the post without it), TLOU2, The Walking Dead Season 1, Bioshock Infinite.

Movie spoilers: The Dark Knight Rises.

OK, let me start of by saying a lot of this is of course subjective and comes down to why you consume media. For me personally, games and movies/tv shows basically serve as escapism. It helps deal with chronic depression and other shit at least temporarily. So say playing Batman in the Arkham series and feeling like a total badass or fighting my way through zombie-infested hallways in Resident Evil feels tense and thrilling.

But in recent years as games try to be ""high art"" it seems a lot of writers/developers seem to think in order to be ""deep"", you need to be dark. Best example TLOU2 (disclaimer: I didn't personally play it, since it's console exclusive and I'm not gonna buy a Sony box because of arbitrary exclusivity crap, but going off fan reaction), which ""subverted expectations"", by treating established characters like shit and got lauded by the sycophantic gaming press for it. We've seen the same in movies with the complete destruction of Star Wars at the hands of Disney, by ""subverting expectations"" and treating beloved characters like garbage and turning them into absolute failures and jokes. It is also the main reason I hated The Dark Knight Rises. The first 2 movies were a pretty cool Batman origin story and then in the third he becomes a shell of his former self and get's written out of his own story before it even began (I mean, taking the TDKR timeline, Batman was active for maybe a year or two before ""retiring""? Like wtf?).

And then we have Cyberpunk 2077. For me, this game is one of the most immersive, if not the most immersive game I have ever played, simply because of how it tells its story and how it forces you into this interactive first-person perspective even for cutscenes. >!Now, the general story is pretty cool and it has some of the most believable and likeable characters in gaming, but for me it all falls apart with the endings. I got spoilered very early on unfortunately and now despite otherwise absolutely loving the game, I just can't force myself to go on, because all the endings, no matter what you do, have the same main result: V dies or has their body taken over by Johnny. You practically fail the story's main objective of saving V's life.!< And yes, it's a dystopian setting, ""why were you expecting sunshine and flowers in a cyberpunk game"" etc, but that imo misses the point and mixes up setting and plot. You can have positive stories in bad settings, that don't make you feel like utter shit. Take the movie Dredd, which is definitely one of my favourite movies of the last decade. The setting is an even worse cyberpunk world than 2077's, but it still has a satisfying arc for its main characters that doesn't end by making you feel like crap.

Another bad offender for me was Bioshock Infinite (especially its DLC). I already didn't like the main game's story, because multi-verse stories are always a clusterfuck and a convenient tool for lazy writing, but then of course in the DLC they also had to kill off Elizabeth and connect their crappy new story to the masterpiece that was the original Bioshock. Because if you're gonna tear down a franchise, then do it completely, I guess.

And I certainly don't have a problem with sad or even bad endings in media, if it's well-written and doesn't feel like nihilistic crap. Take Telltale's The Walking Dead Season 1. Lee dies in the end and it's honestly one of the saddest scenes in gaming, but it doesn't feel bad, because he died making sure Clemetine has a future. And even completely bad endings can be fine, if they fit the tone of the story and are ""earned"" so to speak. 

**My point** (finally lol) is this: it feels to me, that in recent years many games and movies seem to be more interested in ""subverting expectations"" and being ""deep"" by making the consumer actually feel bad after playing the game or watching the movie. And this nihilistic perspective fits perfectly into the ""woke"" mentality: being constantly angry, because nothing is ever enough and everything sucks, so you can't have positive characters, hopeful stories, or worst of all ACTUAL escapism. Because if you're ""escaping"" into a story that makes you feel good, then you're not listening to the constant hate and negativity that's spewed at you from all sides nowadays...",KotakuInAction,OK sure really belong I think since I address influence pop culture critic journalist progressive culture Middle part rant example feel free skip conclusion want Also SPOILER WARNING follow game Cyberpunk I spoiler tag section want read post without The Walking Dead Season Bioshock Infinite Movie spoilers The Dark Knight Rises OK let start say lot course subjective come consume medium For personally game show basically serve escapism It help deal chronic depression shit least temporarily So say play Batman Arkham series feel like total badass fight way hallway Resident Evil feel tense thrilling But recent year game try high art seem lot seem think order deep need dark Best example disclaimer I personally play since console exclusive I gon na buy Sony box arbitrary exclusivity crap go fan reaction subvert expectation treat establish character like shit get laud sycophantic game press We see movie complete destruction Star Wars hand Disney subvert expectation treat beloved character like garbage turn absolute failure joke It also main reason I hat The Dark Knight Rises The first movie pretty cool Batman origin story third becomes shell former self get write story even begin I mean take TDKR timeline Batman active maybe year two retiring Like wtf And Cyberpunk For game one immersive immersive game I ever play simply tells story force interactive perspective even cutscenes Now general story pretty cool believable likeable character game fall apart ending I get spoilered early unfortunately despite otherwise absolutely loving game I ca force go endings matter main result V die body take Johnny You practically fail story main objective saving V life And yes dystopian set expect sunshine flower cyberpunk game etc imo miss point mix set plot You positive story bad setting make feel like utter shit Take movie Dredd definitely one favourite movie last decade The set even bad cyberpunk world still satisfy arc main character end make feel like crap Another bad offender Bioshock Infinite especially DLC I already like main game story story always clusterfuck convenient tool lazy write course DLC also kill Elizabeth connect crappy new story masterpiece original Bioshock Because gon na tear franchise completely I guess And I certainly problem sad even bad ending medium feel like nihilistic crap Take Telltale The Walking Dead Season Lee die end honestly one sad scene game feel bad die make sure Clemetine future And even completely bad ending fine fit tone story earn speak My point finally lol feel recent year many game movie seem interested subverting expectation deep make consumer actually feel bad play game watch movie And nihilistic perspective fit perfectly wake mentality constantly angry nothing ever enough everything suck ca positive character hopeful story worst ACTUAL escapism Because escape story make feel good listening constant hate negativity spew side nowadays

99,"Man, I didn't want to post another anti-CP '77-hatedom comment, I really didn't. The last time I did this, I got so worked up that I ended up threatening to report people in the comment, resulting in me taking it down. But after seeing what Youtuber LegacyKillaHD got up to... ...I just can't take this anymore.

Basically, LegacyKillaHD made a video titled ""CD Projekt Red EXPOSED!!!"", where he opened up by saying that the demos and trailers for Cyberpunk 2077 were a ""facade""; nothing but lies. And then I proceeded to stop watching and unsubscribe. This video was depressing on two fronts: First, it confirms my belief: The belief that the Cyberpunk 2077 hatedom is beyond repair. But it also revealed the worst part about these total dingbats: They're a virus!

Basically, how the hatedom works is: They make a CRPG that is average at worst look like a disaster. They also make it look like the people behind it are lying, communist-supporting corpo scumbags, which is pure misinformation of the highest magnitude, as anyone with a functioning brain could put together. They then proceed spread their beliefs across the internet. Because they come in sheer numbers, they end up convincing people that their belief is law. And once they've successfully let their beliefs infect someone, that someone joins the echo chamber and proceeds to deliberately spread more misinfo and lies to bring more mindless sheep to their cause. And judging by LegacyKillaHD, they can infect anyone.

The hatedom works like a Virus: Poisoning and Infecting people and basically destroying them on a mental level. And because a good number of gamers out there use consoles for their fix, *they're spreading like wildfire.*

I think I've found the perfect competition for Doom 3 and Sonic the Hedgehog's hatedoms as ""The Most Toxic Hatedom for a Videogame Ever"": I foresee that in the future, people will be trashing Cyberpunk 2077, a game which they probably haven't played, because they've been infected and indoctrinated by the misinformation and so bashing that game will make them more proud of the games they like. It is absolutely depressing and disgusting that we live in a world where freaking idiots are taking First World Problems to new levels all because CD Projekt Red ended up making bad console ports rather than working on their main version (PC). The fact that popular Youtubers are in on it further depresses me, and honestly... ...these people are awful.

I'm not going to get infected. When I play CP '77, I'll go in with an open mind, and focus on the GAME. I do not want to hear anymore idiots poisoning the well with lies and misinfo, and I'm going to stay away from Youtubers who spread this shit.

Okay, now you Cyberpunk 2077 haters can post your comments about how wrong I am and how LegacyKillaHD, Jason Schreier and other journalistic hacks are heroes. I'll block you, but I will not report you because you'll prove my point. Go on, I dare you!

EDIT: Huh. For every member of the CP '77 hatedom, there's a constructive person in the comments lending their thoughts on the situation with rationality and reason. Huh. I will definitely play CP '77 in the future, but right now, when it comes to Role Playing Games, I'm busy making my way through the Mass Effect sequels. To all the people posting replies rationally and constructively:  Thank you.",KotakuInAction,Man I want post another comment I really The last time I I get worked I end threaten report people comment result take But see Youtuber LegacyKillaHD get I ca take anymore Basically LegacyKillaHD make video title CD Projekt Red EXPOSED open say demo trailer Cyberpunk facade nothing lie And I proceed stop watching unsubscribe This video depress two front First confirm belief The belief Cyberpunk hatedom beyond repair But also reveal bad part total dingbat They virus Basically hatedom work They make CRPG average bad look like disaster They also make look like people behind lie corpo scumbags pure misinformation high magnitude anyone function brain could put together They proceed spread belief across internet Because come sheer number end convince people belief law And successfully let belief infect someone someone join echo chamber proceeds deliberately spread misinfo lie bring mindless sheep cause And judge LegacyKillaHD infect anyone The hatedom work like Virus Poisoning Infecting people basically destroy mental level And good number gamers use console fix spread like wildfire I think I find perfect competition Doom Sonic Hedgehog hatedoms The Most Toxic Hatedom Videogame Ever I foresee future people trash Cyberpunk game probably play infect indoctrinated misinformation bash game make proud game like It absolutely depress disgust live world freak idiot take First World Problems new level CD Projekt Red end make bad console port rather work main version PC The fact popular Youtubers depress honestly people awful I go get infect When I play CP I go open mind focus GAME I want hear anymore idiot poison well lie misinfo I go stay away Youtubers spread shit Okay Cyberpunk hater post comment wrong I LegacyKillaHD Jason Schreier journalistic hack hero I block I report prove point Go I dare EDIT Huh For every member CP hatedom constructive person comment lend thought situation rationality reason Huh I definitely play CP future right come Role Playing Games I busy make way Mass Effect sequels To people post reply rationally constructively Thank

104,"I'm a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which is timeless classic that inspired an entire generation of TV shows. For its time, it was very progressive, especially on gender issues and LGBT issues, although not on race issues, which would be good opportunity to show a a TV series that made it right.

I'm as socially progressive as it gets. But I hate obnoxious SJWism and wokeness in shows like Supergirl and pretty much everything on The CW and lot of Netflix stuff like Teenage Bounty Hunters. According to SJWs, it's fine and dandy to write minority characters, who are defined solely by their minority characteristics like gender, sexual orientation or race, to make storylines revolving around woke politics, even though it's not meant to be the point of the show and overall, just to make it all about SJW issues and make it extremely over the top, instead of subtly.

Buffy did none of those things. It created well written and well fleshed out female characters who didn't have the need to say they're women every 5 minutes and who had complex personalities, while in spite of their strengths, still decisively feminine. It was ahead of its time on LGBT issues, because it was one of the first TV shows ever to portray LGBT people as relatable characters.

I'm saying that, just to make an example. What are some good shows to watch that are progressive, but not overly obnoxious? This issue is mostly related to sci-fi and fantasy, so I'm looking for good sci-fi or fantasy shows that won't punch me in the face with stuff that I already agree with.",KotakuInAction,I huge fan Buffy Vampire Slayer timeless classic inspired entire generation TV show For time progressive especially gender issue LGBT issue although race issue would good opportunity show TV series make right I socially progressive get But I hate obnoxious SJWism wokeness show like Supergirl pretty much everything The CW lot Netflix stuff like Teenage Bounty Hunters According SJWs fine dandy write minority character define solely minority characteristic like gender sexual orientation race make storyline revolve around wake politics even though meant point show overall make SJW issue make extremely top instead subtly Buffy none thing It create well write well flesh female character need say woman every minute complex personality spite strength still decisively feminine It ahead time LGBT issue one first TV show ever portray LGBT people relatable character I say make example What good show watch progressive overly obnoxious This issue mostly related fantasy I look good fantasy show wo punch face stuff I already agree
106,"Youtuber Uncle Roger (aka Mr. Nigel Ng), a Malaysian Chinese who is currently living in the UK, delete a video from his youtube channel after criticized by mainland Chinese fans.

The said video is a collab with another food youtuber Mike Chen (Strictly Dumpling). Mike Chen is a known Chinese dissident and outspoken CCP critic. However, according to Uncle Roger, he is unaware of Chen's political opinion when the video was made.

The above video was only uploaded in Roger's youtube channel and was not shown in his mainland China weibo account, but this didn't escape from his mainland Chinese fans. After getting called out on Chinese social media, he deleted the video and issued an apology.  

In his apology, Ng said he was not aware of Chen's ""past incorrect remarks about China” before they collaborated. He promised to be more careful in future. 

Mike Chen responded on his Instagram page, saying: 

“I think that what happened here is the result of the \[Chinese Communist Party’s\] censorship, even if it wasn’t direct censorship …

“They will use their soft power to get people to self-censor because they are afraid of losing business in China or offending Chinese people.

110,"Please comment. Even just a ""TLDR, love you pal"" Is appreciated.

Gamer gate was one of the first big things that happened online when I was on the web. I went on YouTube because I was a naive highschooler, who wanted to figure out if he should believe in god or not right when that phase of public discourse was happening. I learned to love debate, and the back and fourth between the two positions. I was religious, but after listening to enough arguments and engaging in the debate internally I changed my mind. Both sides agreed that talking the issue through would make everyone a better person. Challenging your beliefs, putting yourself out there, listening to opposing points of view was almost noble ... And even if we disagreed we could have MUTUAL RESPECT for each other. We could say, at the end of a debate: ""I don't agree your position is logical, but I don't think you should be censored for it"".

Even as the default socialist I was of public education I found Sargon of Akkad's channel and got into gamer gate. The feminism V egalitarianism days did loose much of the mutual respect that was offered in gays gone by,  had a very important element to them: we genuinely thought that if we debated the other side, we would change their mind or have our minds changed. We trusted them to be people like us. Rational, reasonably intelligent, and capable of changing their mind if you refuted their argument. That was before the bans. Before our dark winter. Remember when lacy green dated Chris ray gun and she wanted to host friendly debates between the two sides? And our side generally said: YES! We'll forgive everything you ever said online if you'll just sit down and talk. It was a time where literal Nazis were online and the sentiment was: wow they are really wrong about some stuff, we'd better make a video with our opinion on why their arguments are wrong.

Is that ever coming back? Debate with acceptance of the other? I think something broke during the Trump years. Something... vital. As Tim Poole says ""we live in separate realities""

So many channels are being taken down now, so much content. Stefan Molenaux had the biggest philosophy show IN HISTORY, gone. I found out punished creepworks is gone..? Just gave up after youtube inc harassmed him. So much talent is quitting, so much potential is being driven off, alternative sites are barely hanging on ... all because Google decided to socially engineer the internet to gain political power. I feel distraught.

Will the time of free expression ever come back? Will the melting-pot of ideas ever be restored? Or was it all a mirage of what could have been... a wild west of the internet to be conquered and paved over to make way for the grey. Corporate news and mindless shallow comedy as far as the eye can see ... barely better than television, with only faint echos of individuality and passion.

128,"So the [official announcement](https://archive.fo/2fRHk) has come out regarding *Candlekeep Mysteries*, an anthology of seventeen adventures for D&D 5th Edition that will be released on March 16th of this year.

Among the list of people who wrote these adventures is none other than Daniel Kwan, otherwise known as the guy who [lost his shit](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/hi4yqp/socjus_comicbookcom_dungeons_dragons_fans_seek/) so hard over the old AD&D 1E book *Oriental Adventures* being sold as a PDF that he not only got WotC to add a [sensitivity disclaimer](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/hn7rky/news_wizards_of_the_coast_adds_disclaimer_to_the/) to literally **all** of their old D&D PDFs' sales pages, but then got to [host a WotC-approved panel](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/iqyyha/socjus_daniel_kwan_so_wotc_asked_me_i_wanted_to/) where he talked about the ""harm"" that book is apparently still causing. What the fuck, WotC? Why would you keep bending over for someone whose entire claim to fame is how much of a problem he has with what you do?

Not only that, but one of the adventures...you know what? I'll just quote the EN World article:

>One of the adventures, by Jennifer Kretchmer, is called *The Canopic Being*. It's 10-12 pages, designed for a single session.
>
>Like all the adventures it starts in Candlekeep, the greatest library in the *Forgotten Realms*, and features a dungeon located in Tashalar far to the south of the Sword Coast. As a wheelchair user, Kretchmer's adventure is a dungeon crawl beneath the earth, filled with fantasy elevators and ledges accessible by ramps.
>

135,"Well I figured an alternative platforms list  might be of some use to people who may not know about them and add my opinion on each or whatever I happen to know of them. Some of these are still corporate but lesser used ones

I'm not linking to them because some of it will likely get this place in trouble or require mods to ok the post. 

----
**Social media.**

* Mastedon - I can't say much on it other than for a while it was the Left Wing alternative Twitter where Wil Wheaton was deemed too Toxic for it and banned. It's meant to allow decentralised individually hosted communities so people might be able to set up a community there but who knows.
 
* Minds - I've been on there a while and it's ok but expect a lot of political stuff and stuff about Covid and the Great Reset etc. It's good enough but nothing spectacular. It does have video options and blogging tools built right in though.
 
* Parler - Well it's down right now but due to come back up. I personally found some of the stuff better than twitter with the option to only show content from those you follow, show content from those you follow and things they've shared and an option to subscribe to people to have them and their posts appear on a special feed (useful for people who don't put out a lot of content so you don't miss their stuff).
 
* MeWe - pushes itself as a facebook alternative, I can't say much else as I've not really used it.
 
* Gab - Well I've not used it but it's apparently very right wing on there and the owner hates porn 
 
* NewTumbl - It's honestly one I want to see do well because it's got a very good system to give you curated newsfeeds based on just what you want. Most of my home feed is video games comic books and movie related posts so you can engage is pure escapism. It has I'd argue a better interface than Tumblr (think pintrest's grind system) and lots of options to customise you experience ) It has adult content once you've signed up but options to adjust your feed so not show adult content when in settings where you would want people seeing you viewing it The only downsides are the common system lacks an option to reply to comments made by people directly and no visual previews for links or youtube videos it's just title links no thumbnails etc for such stuff.

----

**Video platforms**

* Vimeo - It's a premium platform but I've heard some people do fine there and I know Jessie Cox was using it to host his more adult orientated Gentlemens gaming club episodes. Free to watch videos but I believe pay to use for people who want to host videos there.

* Dailymotion - one of the older video sites going and probably one of the early rivals to youtube it's somewhat corporate but it's very much not that tightly controlled. It's old enough to be on most devices and even a lot of Smart TV boxes have apps for it. It's so old and established you can upload directly to it from PS4 consoles too. It did also have a system at one point similar to youtube to allow monetising content too though I' not 100% sure how it works
 
* Bitchute - pushes as very much a censorship free platform alternative to youtube.
 
* Odysee - Youtube Alternative that's fairly new and starting out I haven't really used it much sorry

* Veoh - Was literally Youtube's number 1 competitor in the early days but had a lot of business issues come up. It's now an owned by an Israeli-American technology company and seems to mostly be full of Japanese / Chinese users videos.

---

**Patreon Alternatives**

* Subscribestar - billed as a more free from censorship Patreon.

* Locals - I don't know much more about it sorry.

* Sponsus - again I don't know much, I know Leonard French seems to like them.

* Ko-Fi - More of a tip jar system but apparently it does offer subscriptions too now from what I understand.

138,"In a post I made earlier ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/kv8tbo/gaming_sony_removes_reference_to_vrr_and_allm/)), Sony had removed the variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM) checkmarks from their US page for the HDMI 2.1 features of the X900H TV. In a [livestream from Stop the FOMO](https://youtu.be/HgEA3YRzHIk) with Robert Zohn of Value Electronics, Robert clarified from his high level contacts at Sony (apparently his retailer is a major partner for both Sony and LG), that the update is still coming, but a miscommunication caused it to be removed from the US website. This is very late in the video if you want to skip to that part.

Robert said that Sony just isn't ready to roll out the HDMI Forum VRR and ALLM update on their TVs, but that a miscommunication from the engineering part to the marketing part had the marketing team remove the checkmarks on the website in the US, while other markets kept them and were telling customers that the update was still coming. He also said Sony will be making an official announcement in the very near future regarding this (*maybe* as early as January 12, 2021). **NOTE:** There is still no official word from either Sony or AMD as to whether the PS5 supports, or will support AMD FreeSync as a method of VRR (some TVs can support FreeSync, FreeSync Premium, or FreeSync Premium Pro); while the Xbox One S/X (not the original Xbox One) support FreeSync, and the Xbox Series X and Series S support FreeSync Premium Pro, out of the box, as well as HDMI Forum VRR.

**Stop the FOMO has already updated his titles on his videos on this subject based on this new information.**

Robert mentioned something else interesting, as well: that *supposedly* VRR and ALLM are already working on the PS5 ***when it is connected to a Sony TV like the X900H/950H.*** This isn't the HDMI Forum VRR (or FreeSync) and ALLM, but apparently a Sony version that works between the PS5 and Sony TVs. Supposedly this works in the background, and helps to make the PS5 look smooth on Sony TVs. As to how true this actually is, well, we're going to have to take this with a grain of salt as it is coming from Sony talking about 2 Sony products working together-- so this *could* be true, or it could be a marketing ploy to try and get people to buy a Sony TV for use with the PS5.

I should mention that VRR and ALLM are gaming-only features that non gamers won't care about. Non gamers don't need a variable refresh rate for consuming TV and movies, nor would they be setting their TVs in game mode to watch that content. These features are only for gaming with consoles that support them (Xbox One S/One X \[not the original Xbox One\], Xbox Series S/Series X, and the PS5 in the future), and if hooking up a PC to the TV to use as a gaming monitor. 

The major issue in HDMI 2.1 compatible TVs, currently, is that VRR is FUBARing the HDR if people try to use VRR and HDR at the same time (as seen on the LG OLEDs and Samsung TVs that support HDMI 2.1 VRR and FreeSync, right now). So the choice for gamers is HDR ***OR*** VRR to help prevent stuttering/screen tearing on TVs that support HDMI Forum VRR and/or AMD FreeSync (and the few TVs that support NVIDIA G-Sync). Also apparently eARC support is also messed up, and this affects gamers and non gamers trying to use it with their receivers. Both of these problems are apparently an HDMI 2.1 problem, right now, not specific to any TV.

X900H/950H owners or recent purchasers should now wait for Sony's statement before considering returning/replacing these TVs. I'm sure many on here don't really care too much about TVs, but for people who do want to have TVs that are going to let them get the most out of the gaming equipment hooked up into them, I think they'd want to know about this. I, personally, just bought a new TV to be ready for when I can get the new consoles, that supports 4k120, HDMI Forum VRR and FreeSync Premium (Premium and Premium Pro are necessary to get VRR to work at under 40fps), and ALLM; replacing my more than 10 year old TV. So I figured this sort of information would be something some on here would be interested in.",KotakuInAction,In post I make earlier Sony remove variable refresh rate VRR auto low latency mode ALLM checkmarks US page HDMI feature TV In livestream Stop FOMO Robert Zohn Value Electronics Robert clarify high level contact Sony apparently retailer major partner Sony LG update still come miscommunication cause remove US website This late video want skip part Robert say Sony ready roll HDMI Forum VRR ALLM update TVs miscommunication engineering part marketing part marketing team remove checkmarks website US market keep tell customer update still come He also say Sony make official announcement near future regard maybe early January NOTE There still official word either Sony AMD whether support support AMD FreeSync method VRR TVs support FreeSync FreeSync Premium FreeSync Premium Pro Xbox One original Xbox One support FreeSync Xbox Series X Series S support FreeSync Premium Pro box well HDMI Forum VRR Stop FOMO already update title video subject base new information Robert mention something else interest well supposedly VRR ALLM already work connect Sony TV like This HDMI Forum VRR FreeSync ALLM apparently Sony version work Sony TVs Supposedly work background help make look smooth Sony TVs As true actually well go take grain salt come Sony talk Sony product work together could true could market ploy try get people buy Sony TV use I mention VRR ALLM feature non gamers wo care Non gamers need variable refresh rate consume TV movie would set TVs game mode watch content These feature game console support Xbox One X original Xbox Xbox Series X future hook PC TV use game monitor The major issue HDMI compatible TVs currently VRR FUBARing HDR people try use VRR HDR time see LG OLEDs Samsung TVs support HDMI VRR FreeSync right So choice gamers HDR OR VRR help prevent tear TVs support HDMI Forum VRR AMD FreeSync TVs support NVIDIA Also apparently eARC support also mess affect gamers non gamers try use receiver Both problem apparently HDMI problem right specific TV owner recent purchaser wait Sony statement consider TVs I sure many really care much TVs people want TVs go let get gaming equipment hook I think want know I personally buy new TV ready I get new console support HDMI Forum VRR FreeSync Premium Premium Premium Pro necessary get VRR work ALLM replace year old TV So I figure sort information would something would interest
152,"According to [this video from Stop the FOMO](https://youtu.be/dfaB1jWtbIc) Sony has removed the checkbox from the HDMI 2.1 features from the X900H TV staying that it would be getting variable refresh rate (VRR), and auto low latency mode (ALLM, automatically putting the TV in game mode when the console signals it is playing a game) in future updates.  

According to commenters on the video, some have talked to a Sony customer service rep and have been told that it was never coming to the TV. This means either the reps are unaware of the change and have been told to just say it was never coming, or Sony is trying to remove the specification update and hoped no one would notice.

[This is an archive of the Japanese page showing the checks in the boxes.](https://archive.vn/Oyopa) The change apparently hit on January 5.

This currently doesn't affect the PS5, as it does not yet support either VRR or ALLM-- also coming in a 'future update', but we'll see-- but it does affect the Xbox Series consoles, and anyone using the TV with a PC.

So, if you bought this TV, or were planning on it, and wanted these gaming features for your consoles, I would reconsider, or consider returning it if you are in your return window.",KotakuInAction,According video Stop FOMO Sony remove checkbox HDMI feature TV stay would get variable refresh rate VRR auto low latency mode ALLM automatically put TV game mode console signal play game future update According commenters video talk Sony customer service rep tell never come TV This mean either rep unaware change tell say never come Sony try remove specification update hop one would notice This archive Japanese page show check box The change apparently hit January This currently affect yet support either VRR ALLM also come update see affect Xbox Series console anyone use TV PC So buy TV planning want gaming feature console I would reconsider consider return return window

> But two years later, when their Toronto studio produced Watch Dogs Legion, there was a deliberate attempt to engage directly with politics when they asked a host of video game commentators, academics, and journalists (including myself) to provide podcasts for inclusion in the game. So, if you are playing Watch Dogs: Legion, you can listen to me talking about stuff like this on the in-car radio. The point I am making here is that games suddenly seemed to take a turn, and now we are getting more companies—like Games for the Many (which was a pro-Corbyn games company)—being very political in a direct sense. 

Alfie Bown 2018:

> My argument is that the two main positions on videogames and violence are both wrong: it’s not that video games allow us to realize our desires — encouraging our natural violent or sexual impulses, etc. — or that they provide us an outlet for desire (stopping us from following those impulses); instead games actually change desire and impulse itself. With GTA for example, it’s not so much that it makes people go out and do violent things, and it’s not that they don’t do violent things in real life because they’ve done them in GTA. Rather, games like GTA create the appearance that there is a desire to do such things, whether we do them or not. If you have a violent game like that, it makes it possible to go and do a mass shooting and then feel that you wouldn’t wanted to have done that if you hadn’t played the game. In that way, I can see the baby boomers — and even Trump today — had something like a point, though they were saying so for all the wrong reasons. The game does have the capacity in, my opinion, to construct and create impulses and desires, which they individual feels to be their own.

> First, rightwing ideologies have been overrepresented and dominant throughout the history of video games. Although affected by context, video games have long focused on the expulsion of “aliens” (Space Invaders to XCOM), fear of impure infection (Half-Life to The Last of Us), border control (Missile Commander to Plants vs Zombies), territory acquisition (Command & Conquer to Splatoon), empire building (Civilization to Tropico), princess recovery (Mario to Zelda), and restoration of natural harmony (Sonic to FarmVille).

> Second, video games put the user to work on an instinctual level, making the gamer feel impulsive agreement with these ideologies. Playing Resident Evil is not equivalent to watching the movie, because the controller-wielding gamer experiences the desires of the game as their own desires – not as the desires of another.

186,"Making this post to head off the flood of posts about this, and to give a more consolidated place to discuss exactly what/who has been hit, so potentially conflicting information isn't being spread out between a half dozen threads.  As of a moment ago, Twitter has suspended [President Trump's](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump) account, in the wake of Facebook taking similar action earlier today.  Hundreds of other accounts appear to have been purged for vague/unspecified reasons, with nothing but a ""this account broke our rules"" statement.

While this is pretty clearly breaching the Censorship line, much of the stuff surrounding this is still Unrelated Politics, which will cause many posts about this to get removed due to our regular rules and the blacklist superceding the whitelist.

Just keep in mind a few things here:

* Local and Sitewide rules still apply to the comments here.  If you start preaching doomer stuff or saying things which the admins can perceive as encouraging violence in any way, your reply will be removed and you may be actioned for it.

* While some of these accounts hit have fairly obvious reasons why they have been purged, *not all* accounts that end up suspended will necessarily be for those same reasons, so be careful with the speculation.

* All other posts about this will be redirected to this megathread.  I'll be setting the default sort to New, so discussion remains relatively fresh rather than new info getting buried.

I'm 18 years old. I haven't lived in a time where being male has brought any legal advantages for my existence, nor have I ever advocated for having those advantages. I haven't ever harassed, catcalled, or groped a woman, nor have I ever lived in a time when that would be acceptable amongst my male peers. I wasn't old enough to vote in the last election, so I have had literally no influence on any political actions relating to women's rights.

And it still ends up being my fault. I still need to be ""held accountable"" for sexual harassment, even though I've never done such a thing and would come down hard on anyone who did. I've ""had my turn and need to let women have theirs"" when it comes to education and employment, even though I haven't gone to college or had a job or any kind of ""turn"" at all. I still need to ""acknowledge my privilege"", even though my experiences in the public school system have shown me that boys are far from privileged when it comes to how they're treated. I still need to ""recognize the damage that you and other men have done to women"", even though I've never laid my hands on a woman, been nasty towards a woman, or helped further any agenda that would hurt women in any way.

Why can't I be treated like an individual and assessed on my actions alone? Why must I be held responsible for things that happened decades before I was born? Why must society now discriminate against me and other men for things that we have no control over? Why should I be hated for the simple fact of possessing a y-chromosome?

It's just so fucking frustrating sometimes.

19,"The 2-8% statistic is misquoted from an old FBI document from 1996 which says most crimes have a false report rate of 2%, but rape has a false report rate of 8%, so false rape reports actually happened 4 times more often than false reports for other crimes. But what’s more important is the fact that this only includes provably false reports and says nothing about unsubstantiated reports. A study conducted by the university Massachusetts Boston 2010 came up with a similar figure as the FBI saying 2-10 of rape reports are false, this study based its figures on the reported rapes which took place over a 10 year period at a single university of which there were 136. Of these 136 reported rapes, 8 were coded as false allegations which is 5.9%. The abstract then goes on to say that these results taken in the context of an examination of previous research indicate that the prevalence of false allegations is between 2-10%. The study then cites a bunch of other studies from 1997 to 2008 then explains how they arrived at that 2-10% figure, they then go on to explain that another 44.9% rape allegations at the university didn’t proceed to prosecution due to lack of evidence, the complaint and refusal to cooperate or the incident not meeting the legal definition of rape/sexual assault. Another 13.9% of rape allegations weren’t coded as true false unsubstantiated or otherwise due to lack of information about those particular cases. When we add together the 5.9% of probably false accusations, the 44.9% of unsubstantiated claims and the 13.9% of uncoded claims, we find that 64.7% of the rape claims that this university over a 10 year period were either false or potentially false, now that’s just one university.

20,"***Let's hear some stories***

When the topic of ""locker room talk"" pops up, I'm sure you've heard a Feminist link that directly to ""toxic masculinity""---that BS Woke concept that implies certain behavioral traits are restricted exclusively to just one sex.

The truth is many men have heard the female equivalent of ""locker room talk."" That's what we're hear to talk about. For instance, how many of you have heard female coworkers talk about the following or similar to:

* all the things they’ve *shared* \*cough\* on OnlyFans (plus all the money they make) and the people they’ve engaged with and which ones they find attractive
* the women who share how they swoon over men in uniforms and how they just want to rip into them (can you imagine the reaction if a guy just announced he would walk up to a woman and rip her top off?)
* Which celebrities or coworkers they want to wrap their legs around
* the female managers who openly share what type of lube they think works best because it doesn't burn their vaginas (seriously, not only did she talk about that stuff with her coworkers, she's the type that acts all offended and ""professional"" if *you talk about sex* cuz that's a No-No)
* or the women who love to socialize with gay men in similar lewd conversations *in your presence* because, by their own admission, they feel safe to talk all they want about dicks with guys present

Yes, I've heard this type of chatter before in the workplace, and I'm sure many of you out there have heard all kinds of things.... ***so let's hear them. Share your best one(s), don't care how many you want to talk about.***

I know men can talk about boobs all day and say a bunch of things in locker rooms, I would just prefer if we stop pretending that one sex does this stuff just to justify their Woke beliefs that ""toxic masculinity"" is a real thing.

That makes perfect sense if you understand the definition of rape used by sexual violence researchers.

For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced penetration. Feminist professor Mary P Koss that explains that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her in her own voice explain - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn. I encourage you to listen to what she is saying. Really. Listen to it!

She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US. She is the one that started the 1 in 4 college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the ""victims"" didn't. A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is a sexual assault on a woman. As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is ""unwanted contact""

You see she really was instrumental in creating the methodology most (including the US and other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.

Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (June 1993) Page: 206

            Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.

Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf

She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. There was a proposal to include forced envelopment in the latest FBI definition to rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared. She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime. Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.

Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the ""rape"" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but the CDC also gathered the data for ""made to penetrate"" (enveloped) in the 2010 and 2011 NISVS studies.

As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm

    an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey

and

    The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.

vs

    an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey

and

    Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by your assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of ""made to penetrators"" are women ... then an estimated 41% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.

But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/)

And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.

2010 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf

Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known

data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.

And...

A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.

The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/

a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.

And...

National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,’ 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”

Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers

when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).

36,"I'm not one to preach the term 'sexist' easily. I understand the extreme nature of the term so I don't use it lightly. With that being said, I am currently attending Sixth Form in England (ages 16 to 18), and Law is one of my chosen subjects. My class has 3 boys including myself, and about 25 girls. I didn't mind this at first, okay, my radar for making friends is very slim, but maybe I can get along well with the girls or at least just get my head down and enjoy the course.

The teacher is female, important thing to note. Relatively young for a teacher, so she spends a lot of time each lesson talking to the girls about some recent album that's came out, or some inconvenience they have with putting some make-up on (this is not a generalised stereo-type based comment, they talk about this a lot) and everything else. Okay, I feel slightly neglected in the sense that I can't join in on these conversations, but if I had a male teacher who liked the same things I did, then I wouldn't hesitate to talk to him about football all lesson.

But when the actual class gets going, minor instances build up to me just feeling uncomfortable... The 'casual conversation' I mentioned between the teacher and students normally goes to talk about how lazy and irritating men can be sometimes, and how they would enforce a curfew if they could for men, and then at what times the curfew would start and they just start discussing a male-free utopia. Then they start talking about privilege.

All of this is amplified by the fact that often, in Law A-Level, the teacher will make up a story to help us understand a legal concept, so we need to apply the legal concept to the context of the story and see who is liable and all of that, in these stories, the victim will often be the female and nearly all of the time it is the Male that has been negligent of their child or abused their wife or mistreated female colleagues. It's never a woman committing the crime.

In addition, if the teacher is mentioning an actual case, she'll mention how some man killed his wife, and then a girl in the class will say something along the lines of ""That's shitty"" and then someone else will say ""Men are trash in general"" and all of these case examples and stories just feed into the narrative of the casual conversation and it creates a very toxic classroom environment. Finally, the teacher tends to commend the female students more, she'll never tell a girl that they straight up got the question wrong but she's very blunt to me whenever I get a question wrong. I'm not using this as my main point as this could be a coincidence but I'm just pointing it out.

I think this is the result of the teacher being slightly sexist and the ongoing 'men are trash' narrative that is trendy to preach if you are a teenager. A Law class of 95 percent girls gives the girls a perfect time to put men in a bad light and not reap consequences. I'm a 16 year old student and I just feel uncomfortable in my Law class.

48,"I won't name any names in this, for obvious reasons.  Some years back, it was my job to help a man get his security system up and running, including cameras.  What was going on was he was recently divorced and had visitation rights with his 13 year-old daughter.  However, his vindictive and hateful ex wife was trying to destroy his visitation rights, and his relationship with his daughter altogether.

For those of you not familiar with security cameras, let me explain.  There are two basic approaches to making recordings.  1. You could have cameras that use motion detection to choose whether to record.  No motion = no recording, but if someone walks in front of the camera, it triggers motion and you thus get a clip that gets placed on the cloud.  The idea is to only record what's relevant.  There is no continuous recording.  2. Continuous recording to an SVR.  As the name suggests, this type of system records continuously and keeps the video saved to a hard drive on an SVR, a device similar to the DVR that you use to record TV.

So my job was to get this gentleman's cameras converted over from the motion-based recording system to a continuous SVR-based one.  His reason for wanting the change was simple.  His ex wife was falsely accusing him of molesting their 13 year-old daughter.  He felt the need to have positive proof that he was doing no such thing.  I knew for a fact he wasn't.  If he were doing that, the continuous video would prove that he was.  But he wanted the video system just to get the courts to believe him.  So much for innocent until proven guilty.  Of course, there are some rooms where you typically would not want to have cameras recording, such as the bathroom and the bedroom.  So his plan was to keep the door to the bedroom locked so that she could not go in there even if she wanted to.  Then if she went to the bathroom, he would stay in view of one of the cameras.

I felt bad for the guy, but I was glad to help him defend himself.  I also made sure to state that I'm not a lawyer, but rather a security specialist.  I could help him set up his system and learn how to use it, but I also strongly recommended that he speak with his lawyer to make sure that his strategies were sound.

I never did find out what happened with this gentleman.  Once my job of getting his system up and running was over, I was no longer in touch with him.  The security dealer was then taking over the monitoring of his system.

However, there is one thing I've noticed.  When I relay this story to let feminists know that, yes, false accusations are a real thing that sometimes can happen, they act hostile.  I've been accused of being a ""rape apologist"" for trying to help an innocent man defend himself.  I can only imagine the vitriol his lawyer must get.  The ""believe all women"" slogan is nonsense.  There is no group of people on this Earth that never lies and is never mistaken.  And just because I helped one man to protect himself does not mean I have any sympathy for actual rapists.

Another job I had was to set up an SVR and cameras for a high school teacher to use in his classroom, especially for when he did one-on-one consultations with his students.  He was an unmarried man like me, and was often met with unwarranted suspicion.  With cameras constantly rolling, he had the ability to prove his innocence if he needed to.  Those SVRs don't have unlimited space, btw.  They usually have a 1, 2, or 4 terabyte hard drive.  Depending on the resolution and the number of cameras hooked up to it, it will typically have something like 30 or 60 days worth of footage.  So I had to help the teacher set up a backup system as well, a RAID device that could hold a massive amount of data.  That way he could be protected if someone accused him of molesting them 2 years ago or something.  But even then, there was still the possible danger of footage getting destroyed in a disaster such as a fire or a flood.

What's very disturbing is the number of times I've had conversations with feminists about the importance of due process, and the fact that false accusations are real.  Most of the time, the feminist has shown no concern for the protection of innocent men.  It's baffling to me how some people will take my view that ""you need to protect the innocent from false accusations"" to mean ""I'm fine with women getting raped.""  I don't see any logical correlation to that.

Camera systems can help innocent men, but they have their limitations.  If their footage is lost, they can't protect you.  If the power goes out and any backup power runs out, they stop recording.  They also only protect in specific areas.  That man could only see his 13 year-old daughter in his own home where he knew he was protected.  So much for taking a father/daughter trip to a park or an amusement park or God forbid a road trip.

This is just a small sample of people I've helped with security systems.  This is getting long.  But suffice it to say, I've needed to help men in many more situations than the ones described here.  In my own life, I've also experienced people automatically assuming I'm some kind of predator.  People flipped out when I went to a national park with a DSLR camera and a long lens.  I was there to photograph birds, but people assumed I was some kind of perv who wanted pictures of their kids.

I'd doubt I'm the only one with stories like this.  These stories are real.  And I've got a bunch more.

58,"Fathers in Poland, in the event of separation, do not have the right to custody, in over 90% of cases the mother is entitled to care for the child. Polish courts do not recognize fathers as full parents. Children often limit their contacts with the other parent, most often with the father. Currently there is practically no penalty for depriving a child of contact with the other parent. ""Druk 63"" tries to change this by introducing as a priority the use of alternating equivalent care and penalties for the use of parental alienation. Unfortunately, some feminists and their organizations are trying to block these changes. The media in Poland is either not interested in this topic, or they support feminists and show changes in a bad light, completely ignoring the opinions of psychologists about the benefits of alternating care.

65,"Back in 2019 SBS Australia and the Australian Men’s Health Forum (AMHF) reported that the proportions of boys contacting the Australian government and charity funded Kids Helpline had plummeted from 35% of callers to 21% of callers since 2008. This massive failure to engage with boys by the key children’s counselling service was otherwise met with indifference in the mainstream of child mental health service provision and suicide prevention culture. 
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/coronavirus-worries-have-australian-children-calling-kids-helpline-every-69-seconds
https://www.amhf.org.au/kids_helpline_reaching_fewer_boys

Kids Helpline has acknowledged this loss of engagement with boys, but appears to be taking a feminist ideological approach of “boy blaming” when looking for solutions. The Australian Human Rights Commission in conjunction with Kids Helpline, has recently produced a report analysing issues of concern kids have raised in counselling sessions during COVID-¬19, which shows kids have experienced serious impacts on their mental health, social connections and education. But the analysis is fundamentally flawed as the respondents were predominantly female (>75%), and only include a very small proportion of non-LGBTI boys.
https://kiddipedia.com.au/children-experiencing-serious-impacts-during-pandemic/

Kids Helpline conducted a survey of kids using the service and parents, including questions on how to encourage more boys to use the service. However, the questions asked show an entrenched culture of misandry and victim blaming, by focusing poor service use on issue related to masculinity, rather than service provision. 

Q2- How can we engage young boys to have open conversations about their feelings?

Q3- Do you think this is part of a larger conversation about breaking down barriers of gender stereo-types to allow boys to understand it’s ok to be vulnerable & to give them permission to talk about their feelings.?

Q4-Do you think we need to provide more guidance to boys to give them the tools and language to articulate their feelings?

Completely missing from the analysis is any acknowledgement that the service is run by almost entirely by women, both in terms of management and counselling staff, many of who have radical feminist beliefs with histories of public speaking and publications focused almost entirely on the welfare of women and girls. 

This shallow misandrist approach of blaming male stereotypes is entirely sourced from a feminist ideological framing of masculinity (the strawman stereotype), and reveals a service culture at best unsuitable, and at worst, openly hostile to men and boys. The continuing failure of Kids Helpline to engage with boys, and similar problems related to services provided to men and boys by feminist dominated organisations, suggests a high clinical need for discrete services for men and boys, provided by professionals appropriately trained to deliver services without feminist bias and stereotypes, and without male-blaming. 

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that these kinds of effective specialised services will ever be provided given the current gender bias of the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Sex Discrimination Commission, and Kids Helpline. All of these important public services entrusted to provide and oversee the equitable delivery of services to the most vulnerable in our community, are dominated by women with little or no interest in the welfare of men and boys, women entrenched in a culture of feminist stereotypes and misandry.",MensRights,Back SBS Australia Australian Mens Health Forum AMHF report proportion boy contact Australian government charity fund Kids Helpline plummet caller caller since This massive failure engage boys key childrens counsel service otherwise meet indifference mainstream child mental health service provision suicide prevention culture Kids Helpline acknowledge loss engagement boys appear take feminist ideological approach boy blame look solution The Australian Human Rights Commission conjunction Kids Helpline recently produce report analyse issue concern kid raise counsel session show kid experience serious impact mental health social connection education But analysis fundamentally flaw respondent predominantly female include small proportion boy Kids Helpline conduct survey kid use service parent include question encourage boy use service However question ask show entrenched culture misandry victim blame focus poor service use issue relate masculinity rather service provision How engage young boy open conversation feeling Do think part large conversation break barrier gender allow boy understand ok vulnerable give permission talk think need provide guidance boy give tool language articulate feeling Completely miss analysis acknowledgement service run almost entirely woman term management counsel staff many radical feminist belief history public speaking publication focus almost entirely welfare woman girls This shallow misandrist approach blame male stereotype entirely source feminist ideological framing masculinity strawman stereotype reveals service culture best unsuitable bad openly hostile men boys The continue failure Kids Helpline engage boys similar problem related service provide men boy feminist dominated organisation suggest high clinical need discrete service men boy provide professional appropriately train deliver service without feminist bias stereotype without Unfortunately unlikely kind effective specialise service ever provide give current gender bias Australian Human Rights Commission Sex Discrimination Commission Kids Helpline All important public service entrust provide oversee equitable delivery service vulnerable community dominate woman little interest welfare men boys woman entrenched culture feminist stereotype misandry

73,"Why don't feminists care more about men's issues?

Feminism has mixed feelings about directly addressing men’s problems. Many feminists fear that addressing men’s issues, or “gender issues” as a broad goal, will move the conversation completely away from women’s issues (remember, we live in a male-dominated society still). So instead they focus on women’s issues, and allow others to focus on their issues. Many feminists would like to see pro-feminist men tackle men’s issues in a way that doesn’t blame women and feminism for all their problems (see MRAs). Many feminists do care about men's issues, but demanding that feminists dedicate exactly 50% of their time and resources to such things is unreasonable. Please check out

I can't understand feminist non-sense. Men and women must have equal access to employment, which they do. The fact that there is a pay gap does not mean anything. For example, women might have different priorities in life and less experience compared to men. Also, they choose different professions that pay less and are more likely to work part-time. Assuming that women get paid less than men within the same post/company, even though they have the same qualifications, experience and performance, then it could be said that women do not negotiate their salaries hard enough or prefer to apply to lower paying posts/adverts, because they perceive these positions as less competitive.

84,"I was on a therapy website where random people can privately listen to struggles. I was texting a lady there about my sexual struggles when she asked to discuss my sexual thoughts. I vaguely described them and kept the conversation towards ""sex is dangerous for me because of STIs, false accusations, honey traps, criminal prostitution, and etc."" But she kept belittling the dangers and she asked again to describe the thoughts.

Usually I'd describe the thoughts, but they were sexual. Sexual communications are a bannable offense. I've been suspended a lot from that website for sexting. I felt very insecure about describing my thoughts and didn't really want to. So instead, I asked if she ever had sexual thoughts and how those thoughts were.

She just vaguely described the thoughts with ""Great thoughts"" or some similar phrase. Since she answered so vaguely, I replied ""I think you are lying."" So she texted ""I had great sex with my stepson last night,"" or some similar phrase. I immediately blocked her.

Any other man might've asked her to go into details or may have fantasized about that, but I didn't. I remembered a lot of posts on r/mensrights about women who sexually abuse boys and men. 

How would a woman feel if she were talking with a man who said ""I had great sex with my step daughter last night?"" That man would probably be reported to the police for child sexual abuse. Men already face stereotypical allegations of pedophilia, to the extent where some orphanages might reject foster applicants simply due to gender. I've been on a babysitting website where nearly 90% of babysitters were women and where my babysitting account was deleted and refunded without explanation.

Some people might assume the step son is an adult who tempted his step mom. But let's be real: the step mom could've complained about the step son's sexual advances to his father or the orphanage. And then why would the step mom be referencing such incest as a great sexual experience? She has the parental authority alone to thwart off her step son's sexual advances, and to even return him to the orphanage under sexual criminal or civil charges. And why would any step son risk losing a parent or supporter for sex?

Her incest can easily involve into an envious fight between the son and the father. Even without the father, the step mom legally has more power than her step son. She can probably kick him out for a night if he stares at another woman. Incest is horrible and that step son is in a lot of crap now. 

On that therapy website, random women tend to block me whenever I describe my sexual thoughts upon request, but today I ended up blocking a woman instead. The reversal is all very interesting. From now on, whenever I'm having a conversation with another women there, I should ask her about her thoughts before disclosing my thoughts.

85,"I want to preface this by saying that while I am not a self identified feminist, I do agree with and support the core values of feminism in principle. What I don't agree with is the whole #notallmen mockery. The sarcastic, eye rolling, straw man style of argument is a complete double standard. ""Women are materialistic"" = sexist hate speech. Meanwhile, ""Men (the same gigantic generalization) actively try to suppress and control women"" = finally someone had the courage to say it. Then the arguments start and the easiest way to dismiss the opposition is the #notallmen defence. The unspoken, assumed, unwritten rule that all women have the right to bad mouth ""men"" as a general term because they only refer to the many bad guys out there in the world. Anyone who gets offended by the generalization has CLEARLY missed the point. They weren't talking about you. In fact, they take it a step further. Not only is your complaint about their generalization pointless, but it is its own kind of attack on them. They already have so many moleters, harrassers, attackers, and such to worry about. Now, they have to worry about you! A typical man who doesn't get the joke and feels offended. It's no wonder that these feminist women have no patience for comments or criticisms about their choice of words or style of speech. They already feel ignored, exploited, and harmed by social norms and men most of all.

87,"one major advantage I have over 95% of people my age (16m) is my intelligence, most kids my age can’t define the word quanta (an elementary particle related to one of the four forces of nature electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak forces IE: the electron is the quanta of electromagnetism) ffs most kids my age don’t even have a basic scientific understanding outside of the little science we’re taught in school.

Yet I’ve been put down in academics almost my entire life even in science classes of which I already knew most of the shit they taught in those classes years before taking them. It always seemed no matter how much effort I put in my grade would either be the same or worse, almost like someone was just saying “nah fuck you your grade is a 67”.

Before we went virtual for this god awful pandemic I usually got really good grades on tests (80s-90s) except for classes on subjects I wasnt very enriched in and just couldn’t concentrate in like English (70s-80s) but now that they don’t have to return the test and show us what we did wrong my test grades have been around the 50-70 range.

Nothing changed the tests aren’t very hard at all (tbh it’s even easier now that I can Google shit that I forget) but now that tests aren’t being sent back to show me what I did wrong my grades even on subjects I’m very good at and very interested in (which means I actively try to learn more about these subjects outside of school and often ponder about them) like math and science classes are slipping?

Coincidence? Definitely not, like I said the subject material is not hard at all the only real thing holding me back is my poor memory and ADHD (which fucks my concentration beyond belief but only when I’m totally uninterested otherwise I’m fine)

I argued back ""it's not our fault it happened"" (even though now I know perfectly well that women were **never oppressed**) and she said ""well it doesn't affect me so I don't care""

EDIT: A lot of people have been criticizing me for my choice of words saying how women were never oppressed, and I'm sorry for wording it that way. I won't remove it since I want people to see what I really meant. The way mostly every feminist puts it is like women could do nothing and were suffering for the past thousand years, while men were this figure who had control over everyone and had an easy life. **THAT IS WHAT I MEANT.** Sorry for any anger I caused.

The problem with so many of these younger to-be feminists is that they're just taking this ""victim"" attitude like everyone in the world somehow owes them something, and then they grow up to be these nasty, toxic, man-hating feminists who deny all bad things women do in the world yet say stuff like ""men are natural born rapists"".

114,"\*Warning: this could be upsetting or triggering, contains sexual abuse\*

&#x200B;

I saw a story from a guy who was violently raped when he was young.

That already got me upset. But it gets worse.

When he decided to open up and get therapy, the therapist told him that he didn't believe him, and called child protective services on him because they assumed the man was abusing his wife and children. The guy divorced his wife because he was scared he would hurt them or something bad  would happen.

So basically, a therapist, a person meant to believe in and help people, looked at an emotionally unstable person who has been through serious trauma and reached out for help and thought:

This person is a man, he must be terrible.

Honestly, why???

The other thing that made me want to join was Johnny Depp's and Amber Heard's crazy ""Nobody will believe you because you're a man"" thing.

Then there's the overall radical feminist thing. Honestly the worst.

The last thing is, women are really privileged these days, and can be absolutely toxic.

Women also get compliments and such all the time.

* Ridiculous claims disputed below  

> It doesn’t reduce pleasure.

The foreskin is actually the [most sensitive and nerve filled](https://www.google.ca/search?q=foreskin+nerve+endings&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en-ca&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;client=safari) part of a man’s body. Circumcision also removes the rigid band (which isn’t even mentioned in argument). It serves a function and generates pleasure itself. For example, when a guy has all foreskin removed he no longer will get pleasure from his shaft. It’s horrendous, he will have to yank his shaft skin back or use his prostate. More specifically, if you have never noticed: these urologists usually leave a bit of foreskin which dries out over time, unless they are having a bad day and want to ruin a life.

> It reduces HIV exposure.

The foreskin is made of [mucous membranes](https://www.google.ca/search?q=foreskin+membranes&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en-ca&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;client=safari). The function of these membranes: [form a barrier which prevent pathogens from entering](https://www.google.ca/search?q=mucous+membrane+function&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-ca&amp;client=safari). HIV is a pathogen. Lastly, for those who use the studies about reduced HIV. Have you considered these are conducted in Africa where these are not unconscious children whom stop having sex after their traumatic experience. It may seem cliche, but one kind of lie is actually statistics. The full complexity of ‘statistics’ are never exactly expressed. These surveys are subject to bias.

> Foreskin smells bad.

What a ridiculous claim itself but my question is relative to what? Don’t think you could just shower? You are usually comparing it to a vagina, in which case, a 2 slabs of meat which bleed. Lastly, this claim has never been proven, however a vagina bleeding is well known.

> It looks better.

This is a sick and pedophilic claim because this is about a child. However, humans adapt to every form of sex and will develop fetishes if need be. This is not a claim, this is a delusion by those within the society which has acucullophilia.

> It’s for my religion.

This is not a reason. If a religion tells you to do an action, you should judge the action and all of its results. An action has real consequences, you cannot say it doesn’t matter. There are so many ways to dispute this ridiculousness, I won’t even begin. Judging actions on their effects is what any sane person does.

> It makes you last longer.

If you have no pleasure you’ll last the longest, also known as erectile dysfunction. By being circumcised, your glans and foreskin will dry out and become nearly numb as you age. The foreskin keeps everything from drying. There is no solution to this claim desired. Permanent reduction of nerves is no solution to a fantasy. You can always use condoms with a numbing agent. However, you could always learn self control.


Edit:

Genital mutilation does not need to argued with reasoning, it is a sad delusion that people are currently living. I hope for the sake of humanity, some wake up along the others and stand up against this disgusting practice.

If you are a believer in a god but have a good sense of morals, every life that is about to be ruined could use your saving. And for the atheists, as they like to say, we are all tourists and the beauty of nature and the freedom of choice and the freedom to learn must be preserved. 

There is truly no ‘freedom of religion’ if you can force it upon others and make irreversible changes. Freedom really is worth dying for. I hope  in the future, more of us are free from the trap which makes us do evil things.

May we all be humanist in the future. After all - we are all human.

There are companies who propose that to bachelorette/hen parties. What is your opinion from a MRA's perspective ?

A Dominatrix lesson lasts 90 minutes

Friendly, professional and approachable Mistress to gently ease you into the world of BDSM

You will learn about role play, restraints, spanking, foot and boot worship, humiliation and dungeons to name but a few!

Your own personal slave to practice on (can be semi naked or fully naked)

Let's cast aside the issues of cheating etc. 

I find it quite degrading for men and sexist. That is not something who will be seen as acceptable if the gender were reversed. Most western countries apply a ""no touching policy"" to protect female strippers or sexual entertainers. Policy usually not respected for male strippers (I made quite a lot of posts about it) who often face lot of abuses. But you can fin several bachelorette party planner proposing openly this kind of bdsm services with a male slave. Meaning far more than touching.


Edit:  I did not express myself clearly. I have no issues with BDSM practice or men being submissive. But the double standards her is incredible. Could you realmy imagine a service advertizing itself about practicing domination on female slave ? The only thing like that is prostitution. Using prostitution services is seen as not acceptable and is done secretly or even illegal (the service exist in UK and Canada, as far as I know). Legal form of organized sexual work in UK are strip clubs and topless waitresses. And most of the times, laws or city policies ban touching to protect women. But a service to rent and practice on a male slave is advertized as a normal thing. Totally openly. And I believe it comes from how female sexuality is seen as harmless and how men are seen as less worthy of being protected (particularly about sexual violence). This is the same double standard that protect female perpetrators of sexual violence and crush male victims.

126,"So I watch Once Upon A Time( I know it is a guilty pleasure, but has good writing). A minor storyline in it about one if the characters that was brought up was quite interesting. Rumpelstilchen is a mythical creature, as are most of the cast in the show. He gets a see telling him his future son will live without a father if he goes into battle. What he does is injuring himself to go back and raise his son. 

What the show comments a out this is his wife shaming him and doesn't want to know anything off him. Because of what others say about her. She wanted him to die, instead of having the shame. It ends up with her losing all interest in him as a man and husband. She chests in him and doesn't care for her son. She cheats on him and leaves with Captain Hook.

130,"Feminist have pushed Women not perform the feminine role and denounce responsibility to their actions. It's high time men denounce their roles too

In my point of view traditional masculine and feminine role served a purpose. To keep checks and balances for both men and women in the society.

Men provide and commit to protect the house. Women provide kids and make the house into a liveable home. Both promised monogamy and care for each other in marriage.

Now this is being dismantled step by step & promotes favouring only to women.

I am not suggesting mgtow, but some what similar. Sleep around don't commit to relationship, until your extremely sure. Consider this as your marriage. Don't buy her anything concrete(gifts, cars, house or money). If you spend on her make sure you are a part of it like a dinner, vacation trip. Don't sponsor spa & make overs, that's her responsibility to keep her attractive to you. If she pushes for marriage, start searching for your new mate and break up when you find one. You will always find a better one. 

If you are like me and want a kid, hire a surrogate mother (cheaper than a car) to have your own kid or adopt.

131,"So my cousin in Bangladesh got married twice and is currently in the second marriage. I’m not sure what happened to the first one, but the spouse ended up leaving. Now during the second marriage, he is dealing with a woman that’s very abusive (to the point where he has to tell her every place he going to, would call him every hour to check up on where he is, demanded he forget his own family for her sake). He complied to all this for who knows what reason. He was forced to cut off all communication with family. His mom is on her deathbed trying to live just one more day, but his wife is threatening him with divorce and abusing him verbally so he can’t even go to her. My dad called him (we live in Canada so my dad can’t even physically intervene into this) telling him to go visit his mom because all she does is say his name over and over again. So he went to visit his mom without telling his wife, BUT she somehow found out and went to his mother’s home and started to physically and very assault him (slapping and name calling). Later the wife called another of my aunt saying “stop trying to ruin our peaceful marriage, because of you guys he hit me. I’ll divorce him if you guys continue to get in between us and I will destroy him and your entire family.” Now there is no way my cousin would hit her cuz he is scared of her and her family. Plus HE is the victim here, she’s just playing victim. Now what should he do? Because if he tries to divorce her, she will post likely falsely accuse him on doing something he never  did. This is also a country where money speaks and the wife’s family is quite rich and powerful while my cousin is on the poorer side. She also shames him for not having money and giving her anything when she knew from the beginning that he had no money. From what I see, there’s no way he can get out safely.

133,"This post is a rant.

I don't mind if I'm a gay man, I'm just also one of the brothers that I'm fighting for! And I have full empathy! And the discrimination of men and boys angers me!

It's really annoying when someone could pull out t34©H m3N n0T T0 *insert violent crime, ex: rape, pervert, etc.

The context in there is misandristic and it's flawed.
The phrase is often generally implied. The only subject in the context is ""men"".

Teach men not to *insert violent crime. Why though? Do men do that unless they are taught? Even that phrase makes seem the violent crime normalised at the first place.

The criminal be like ""jeez, am I doing bad even though I'm matured enough to understand and know what I'm doing? I have to stop though, thanks for reminding""

Blames the crime is only to men and erases female sexual abusers too.

-------

The mainstream's view regarding masculinity is extremely misleaded. As they see masculinity is only bad stuff like crime and boys can't cry.

And annoyingly, when some guy just did wrong by their personal situation, and that guy happened to be a man, people will blame, toxic masculinity, that it just generalizes men's nature that they do those stuff. I think it's a False Equivalence fallacy, comparing a male criminal, to a male who's just eating ramen at the afternoon with his son, and happened to be both men, assumed that they have the same nature.

The term ""toxic masculinity"" was only originated by the mythopoetic men's movement(1980s and 1990s), which is advocating for self-help and therapy for men. The term became widespread in 2010 when the popular writings, media, and the mainstream has been using the term to refer masculine norms.

You can't remove violence, rigorous ambition, and competence into the male psyche, and that doesn't mean it's bad. It's males' biological instincts, and forcing something to remove at its natural state doesn't do good, it will just cause inappropriation, annoyance, irritate, and ignorance.

The violence can be used to good to fight tyranny like the army, instead of unnecessarily hurt people.

The rigourous ambition that make guys do risky stuff can be harnessed to do heroic actions.

The competence and greed of males can be useful for building economies and sports, rather than cheating.

You can't make good men by making them less men.
You can't make good men, by taking the ""men"" away.
They become good if they stop doing the bad.

Masculinity is not toxic, it's just by how you use it. 

Edit 2: Also saying ""toxic masculinity"" makes this good vs. bad men and this ""man-box"". Every men deserves treatment of care and healing. No should be left behind. All men right?

Edit 5: (bruh, I went too many edits) Just to add that people respond far better to positive reinforcement rather than the negatives. ""Toxic masculinity"" is not even a medical term. It's just a politicised, ideological, divisive, and that has no place in a doctor's practice. 

-----

Plus, the way people say 1t$ 4l$0 d0N3 B¥ m3N to for example, male to male crime, and especially when men are the majority that make the laws and so they therefore imply that it's not an issue even though there is unjust happening in males is just victim blaming. They already blamed the male victim by their own suffering.

Edit 3: Men are also the ones who make the law so it's not a male issue as they imply. Aren't the one who also fight and address men's rights and issues are commonly also men? Yes, just see how they generalize men do and think the same stuff like we're an ideology.

-----

Edit: let's also not forget how the society, portray men as ATM cards. I'm not portraying men that they also have some sort of this ""victim Olympics"". There are also prejudice that men have not known or forgot to. It is sad that they block men's real issues and they just continue to silence us.

140,"Note:  I posted this in LeftWingMaleAdvocates but since my age and karma don't meet their standards, it's been sent into moderation for god knows how long.  Might as well post it here.

I had an awkward childhood with some pretty dark moments even though it was balanced out by decent highlights. Diagnosed autistic at a really young age, I was subjected to a manor of tests at hospital. The female counselors/doctors, suffice to say, were really cruel whenever I did something wrong or failed to understand the task at hand and would just spit vitriol at me and get really physical (like holding my arm tight and forcing a 'normal' motion out of it when writing something).

Elementary School, I was considered awkward and weird. Then attacked for it; teased, mocked, and there were three occasions where a mob of children pantsed me after school. It was scary.

High School was the worst. Just a den or merciless cruelty from both genders. I was almost put in hospital thanks to suicidal ideation from the relentless psychological battering.

Both genders, boys and girls, men and women, knew no bounds in the torture department.

It has left me with anxiety issues and low-self esteem. I'm not a strong, imposing individual in the physical sense. And lack the gumption to fully stand up for myself when people walk all over me like a doormat.

When telling my story, I'd noticed that a lot would rally around me for what males did. Females, however, well, that was difficult. Like society had this blindspot when it came to female cruelty. There was hardly any material on the issue of girls bullying boys. No media depiction of the subject. And don't get me started on how certain individuals of an ideological persuasion dismissing my experiences as nothing compared to what girls are put through, lecturing me on my male privilege.

The most deplorable aspect of where I am right now is that I've developed a deep-seated contempt for all things girl power. Messages like ""I'm a girl. That's my super power. What's yours?"", ""The Future is Female"" and ""Girls Can Change The World"". Constant exposure to strong female characters where their empowerment grants them license to berate, abuse and put down male characters as the makers depict the latter as evil, idiotic, and sex-crazed wastes of space, triggers those scars of the past from the girls I'd experienced in life.

And I hate it. Despise how society, no thanks to feminism, has now chosen to elevate women at the expense of men while portraying their toxic behaviour and abuse as something noble to model for future generations of girls. All their bad habits drowned out by ""Girls are the future"".

It would be one thing having to live with this on a regular basis as a survivor of vicious abuse/bullying from both genders that, unfortunately, can't find many avenues of support for what the girls did to me in comparison to the boys.

Yet when I finally mustered the courage to tell my psychiatrist how those girl power slogans, the east at which they can be used as a cover to excuse abusive female behaviour towards males, made me feel he reasoned ""Well, women have, and still are in parts of the world, still treated like property"".

This shattered my heart. One of many of life's bitter disappointments. Someone I'd been seeing for decades and has, except in this arena, proven a godsend.

It's hard surviving in a ""Female Empowerment"" world where everybody and their grandmother is propping girls up as the solution to world issues.

As someone who's experienced the dark side of females, I can tell you how invisible it makes me feel.

I loathe girl power with every fiber of my being and whenever I hear ""Strong, female character"" I'm like Pablo's Dog except I lash out and nip instead of salivate with hunger.

That's a consequence of what happens when girl power goes too far.

Now I'm a nice guy. Whenever any woman asks me to reach for something that's high on a shelf in a food store, I reach for it.

But I had to get a card, not food. And I had to get it from an ATM machine, not a shelf. So I said that I couldn't help with her card because I didn't want to infect her with COVID-19.

She wasn't disabled. She wasn't old. She was within reach of the card. She just had to use her fingers in a certain way to get it. Did she also want to piggyback on me, to avoid touching the dirty floor?

Any other man might've tried to be chivalrous and aid her, but I've been wary around young women. I don't find much criminal reports about them, and a lot of the known reports seem to portray them as innocent. But I know women, like humans and animals, have the capacity to prey on others.

I think if women want to be in the military, they should have to do the same amount of training as men do. A rule like that shouldn't be considered sexist, and would make more sense.

Having both genders train at different levels from each other in the military may have a chance of causing problems on the battlefield when they are fighting together. Like an example is if someone gets injured, they may need someone to carry them on their back to safety. So it would make sense for someone to have to be able to lift a certain amount of weight in in order to be in the military.

159,"I'm going to argue that it is the division of labour in the home, it is the fact that so many of us fathers feel not just the need to provide for our families, but the obligation that it is solely our duty to make sure the rent/mortgage is paid, that food is on the table and that our kids have access to the resources they need to make it into adulthood as a well balanced, healthy and productive adult themselves.

That should not be the case, the third wave of feminism we are in right now has rightfully championed for women's equality in the workplace, however that same movement actively works against mens equality in the home, while the traditional gender roles at work have been crashing down for 50 year's, the same has not happened for the traditional gender roles at home, both for legislation and societies expectations, and there is a good reason for this.

It is cheaper for our government.

Our government knows that men have been conditioned for hundreds or thousands of years to be the sole income earner in the home, and we do that because we want the best for our families, and that fact it used against us, one of the primary metrics used by the court for who get's primary custody is ""who has been the primary caregiver before separation"" and of course because we want to work and provide for our families, that is the mother.

because we want to provide for our families, our spouses don't have to work, they don't have to grow a career and they end up doing the work at home with our children.

And that's where they have us, during separation our lawmakers know that we can make money, because we have been for years, and they know that it takes money to raise children, so they can get us twice, first they make sure that the mother of our children get primary care of the kids, they know that they have been at home not growing a career for year's, and so cant earn as much, so we pay child support, they know that we will have to work more, and so we will pay more tax, while also subsidising our kids mother through child support, they know that if we get primary care or even 50/50 they will not get as much tax revenue, and will have to support both parents even if its what's best for the children.

So how do we combat this? simply put WE can't, those of us that are already in this situation are going to be stuck in it, as long as the cycle continues like this it's going to stay the same.

But what we can do is try our best to teach our sons, and the young adults in out lives to be careful who they have children with, I think that it's great the women have been given greater access to the workplace, but in order for us to have greater access to our children we have to hold our partners to that, we have to be selective about who we have children with and make sure they are contributing to our families finances well before children are involved, and more importantly we have to make sure that WE are involved in our households and the raising of our children.

162,"I stumbled on this post https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/kxs5gp/quarantine_revealed_something_nasty_about_dating/

Apparently, many women are afraid of unfamiliar men. And they have every right to be - though I don't know if murderers really use dating apps to find victims. And if they do, what are the chances to end up with one?

Anyway, that got me thinking about the occasions when women have tricked me or my friends. 

When I was in my early 20s I travelled a lot in Europe, sometimes alone sometimes with friends. Once I in a railway station in Hamburg waiting for the train, my friend left with a young woman. I didn't know what was going on but later on I found out that she had led him to a room where he got robbed. When he started asking about his wallet, a couple of men entered the room. Luckily, my friend manged to escape. This was early on on our Interrail, but he had to return home having lost most of his money. 

Once in Ibiza I went to a bar - or perhaps it was a nigh club - with a friend. A couple of ladies came to sit with us and asked if we could buy them drinks. You have to remember that we were about 20-year-old guys from Finland. Anyway, I warned my friend against it but he was a rich guy, a drunk rich guy, and ordered drinks anyway. When we got the bill the sum was something so insane that even my friend started to get second thoughts. So, we left for the toilet and managed to get out - though there was some sort of strange curtain labyrinth between the toilet and front door -  and then jumped into a car we had rented and drove away as fast as we could. The only time I have driven while heavily under the influence. 

The first time this pattern emerged on my travels was in Athens where I was without company. Nothing terrible happened but the experience was a bit  scary - and educational. A girl about my age started talking with me in the street. She seemed very nice and seemed to be interested in me. After a while she asked if I wanted to go to a café with her. She led me to this murky place without customers and left immediately after I had sat down. Three older, shady-looking men sat down with me and just stared at me talking to each other in a language I didn't recognize. Without thinking I got up, my heart pounding, mumbled something about leaving, and left. Whatever the plan had been they let me go. (Later on I have learned that you should not act like a victim in a situation like that but show self-assurance. Perhaps I did that without thinking about it by not staying but leaving immediately.)

The second article is about a prostitute who uses a male accomplice, I believe. As always, the man gets arrested and the woman (true culprit) is acquitted or ignored.

If you look for news articles or information concerning prostitutes online, you are going to get a lot of sex worker advocacy or prostitution victimization (or highlighting prostitutes who get hurt by men rather than men who get hurt by prostitutes' STIs or prostitutes' crime schemes.) It's sad to live in a society that defends pathological and criminal predators but punishes their infected or robbed victims. Some people, like my own brother, even victim-blame male victims by saying they are dumb for hiring the prostitutes in the first place. Oh boy, I'm happy that prostitution is illegal where I live: some man has common sense here.

But some articles are encouraging me to do some prostitute-busting on my own. It'd be nice to keep those predators from giving hiv and other diseases to local working men. In the beginning, I might start by busting stray prostitutes before those who use male accomplices.

I stumbled upon the above document tonight, and didn't expect to have been so effected by it. As a victim of child sexual abuse, reading through the above sentiments really fucking hurt me. I don't have anything, no one really to depend on for emotional clarity but myself; which is more or less the point I suppose, I spent so many years denying the pain of a secret I was waiting for permission to let myself in on. Reading through these guidelines made me feel as though I were back before I no longer had the choice of denial, before I was able to free myself from the burden of absolute responsibility for everything I experience, before I realized that existing as I am and feeling how I feel doesn't make me a monster like him; I spent my entire adolescence painting new masks for every occasion, every clique, every moment. Everything was fine so long as I managed to be anything but Myself. But charades is a party game, and suffice it to say, the party ended when loneliness and isolation set upon my every moment. All that time spent acting, like characters in a vapid sitcom. It's no wonder I remember so very little before my 18th birthday, there simply never was anything real to remember; how could I have been so content to live as little more than a means by which to satisfy the situational approval of others? I let myself down, and lost 10 years of my life as a consequence, not to mention all those ""friends"" I spent so much time pleasing and trying to impress. Frankly, I don't want to do that to myself any longer, regardless of whatever people may think of me, I need to vindicate myself against this strange fucking contempt I've shown for myself. So honestly fuck it, why should I second guess my desire to standup on behalf of my own experiences and feelings?

These are emotional claims, though I could certainly condemn them empirically also, however, in this instance, I feel uniquely justified in just being fucking angry about these ""best practices"".

How the fuck do these people find it remotely appropriate, or necessary to teach boys why doing harm to others is wrong? As if I couldn't possibly understand what it feels like to be violated, to be voided of trust and sense of security, to be hurt and to keep being hurt and feel it's okay because no one ever told me it wasn't? As if the only way for my own experiences to matter is dependent on it's relevance to the well-being of others? How fucking dare these people presume the authority to insist upon what my obligations should be, and how exactly it is I ought to behave.

Anyone who is capable of selectively defining a boy's trauma in their own adulterated words for purposes which benefit ANYONE but the boy whose trauma they are addressing, without even bothering to pretend as though they have his interest at heart (god forbid, as a fucking priority), is clearly a deeply immoral person. Why should I matter any less than anyone else? What the fuck gives them the sense that's it's okay to assert MY complicity in the perpetuation of the very violence to which I was victim? Fuck these people. Honestly, I'm done being nice about this, if they want to make me the enemy of their perfidious cult, fine, whatever the fuck it takes to prevent them from doing further harm to innocent boys on the basis of THEIR OWN PROJECTIONS. I am not responsible for the falsehoods, biases, and down right hateful opinions of others. This has to stop. Insisting that boy's are somehow complicit in a system WHICH DOES NOT EVEN EXIST by using satire-worthy double-speak terms like, ""compassionate accountability"", is simply an unacceptable way to treat children.

I felt disgusting, ashamed, and monstrous even without the help of feminist indoctrination, had I been taught to accept those feelings perpetuated largely by MY trauma as realities intrinsic to my identity as a boy? The self-hatred I suffer was once so intense that I fell into a habit of scaring myself with searing metal-tweezers; had I been made to internalize the voice of this document, I'm confident the extent of my self-harm would have fair surpassed merely a wrist covered in burn scars.

Statements like this one:

>Is the program focused on building empathy while not devaluing women or reinforcing the idea that men need to protect women? Does it acknowledge and respect the harms men themselves may have experienced without losing focus on the harms they may have perpetuated?

And

>Does the program create a safe place for men and boys to understand their roles and responsibilities in ending violence? Are safe spaces created for diverse men and boys to learn, reflect, and change?

Seriously? How fucking stupid do they think males are to accept this shit? These feminist ideologues go OUT OF THEIR WAY to clarify that the ONLY reason they aren't stating, in plain terms, that which they believe is not out of a concern for boys\` well-being. Of course not. Rather, the use of meaningless jargon is employed so as to ""facilitate this process in compassionate ways in order to prevent disengagement, resentment, and backlash"", as opposed to the myriad potential harms this psychopathic conspiracy theory is likely to cause a boy in terms of shame, self-hatred, alienation, and absolute demoralization.

Just a final message to anyone capable of looking through the document and not finding it shockingly appalling, and indeed akin to a form of compulsory psychological child-abuse: no, I DO NOT acknowledge my male privilege; no, I AM NOT complicit in an imaginary system you believe to have been created by boys and men for the purpose of abusing women and girls; no, I DO NOT need your approval as a victim of sexual abuse; no, YOU DO NOT get to claim responsibility for my own sense of morality; no, I DO NOT owe restitution to anyone for existing as I have always done: innocently.

If I were capable of submitting to this nonsense, and somehow retained some iota of rationality, I wouldn't waste time in discussions of my ""male privilege"" (whatever the fuck that even means). Nor would I waste my time digging deeper into my cognitive dissonance regarding the illusion that feminism in its current form actually cares about my well-being, I'd simply accept the claim being offered: even in treating a traumatized boy, the goal is not to help him, merely it is to mitigate the threat he poses to women and girls; males are obstacles at best, and threats at worst, and the traumatized one's pose an even greater threat, thus as the well-being of boys and men was never a concern, the absolute most feminist action a male can take is suicide. Right? We're not going to talk about realities. Like the fact that 80% of suicide victims are male, or that 1/6 isn't a particularly dissimilar proportion to 1/4, or any other issue which shows males as a population in clear need of help. We only discuss male mental health after the latest school shooting, that is: another incident of a mass-murder suicide. What the fuck am I to make of that except to say that we clearly don't mind suicides in which the sole victim is also the perpetrator, in fact, we might prefer it when men and boys take their lives, provided he does it out of sight, so as to avoid subjecting potential witnesses to the burden of his last failure.

While it's true that the awareness of the fact that, contrary to popular belief, men and boys do feel pain and do suffer, has risen through the years, I cannot help but feel I'd prefer silence to an awareness which castigates me as an accessory merely to be used. I'd much prefer to be treated as invisible than to be treated as dangerous. To be treated as damaged and THEREFORE dangerous is beyond what I can handle. Time and time again, the world makes itself clear to me: it doesn't care about ME, and when it appears to, I'll never need to look very hard before I find the catch. I feel demoralized, maligned, and willfully misunderstood; if I could pretend not to feel I would, but I can't do that when someone else's words reveal the truth that indeed I do feel, but does so only in order to redefine those feelings in service of it's own goal.",MensRights,I stumble upon document tonight expect effect As victim child sexual abuse reading sentiment really fuck hurt I

# When women insult men:

Rashida Tlaib was elected in 2019 to congress and during her victory announcement she said (on video)

&#x200B;

>people love you, and you win. and when your son looks at you and say "" Mama, look. You won. Bullies don’t win."" and i say ""Baby, they don’t,’ because we’re gonna go in there and **we’re gonna impeach the motherfu\*\*er**""

&#x200B;

She repeated the same insult with the crowd at a rally, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [called the reaction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/05/ocasio-cortez-jabs-gop-over-faux-outrage-following-fellow-democratic-congresswomans-locker-room-talk/) of republicans ""faux outrage"" :

&#x200B;

>“Republican hypocrisy at its finest: saying that Trump admitting to sexual assault on tape is just ‘locker room talk,’ but scandalizing themselves into faux-outrage when my sis says a curse word in a bar,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote. “**GOP lost entitlement to policing women’s behavior a long time ago. Next**.”  
Speaking directly to Tlaib, who on Thursday became the first Palestinian American woman sworn in as a member of Congress, Ocasio-Cortez added: “**I got your back.**”

# Men insulting women:

A year later Ocasio-Cortez had an exchange with congressman Ted Yoho, she said he called her ""disgusting"" and said ""you are out of your freaking mind"" and he was overheard by reporters calling a ""bitch"". but according to him he said ""bullshit"". now regardless of what he said, he apologized for it. but that wasn't enough for her. she rejected his apology making an entire speech in congress [saying](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53521143):

&#x200B;

>""This issue is not about one incident. It is cultural,"" she told lawmakers, calling it a culture ""of **accepting a violence and violent language against women**, an entire structure of power that supports that.""  
""I am two years younger than Mr Yoho's youngest daughter. I am someone's daughter too. My father, thankfully, **is not alive to see how Mr Yoho treated his daughter**.""  
""I am here because I have to show my parents that I am their daughter and that **they did not raise me to accept abuse from men**,"" she continued.

# Analysis:

The same person who said insulting a man is ""faux outrage"" and ""policing women's behavior"" consider insulting a woman as not just a bad behavior, but a culture of accepting a violence and violent language !! notice how she emphasize about who is doing the abuse and who is receiving by saying ""violent language against women"" and ""abuse from men"".

Clearly **the problem for her is not what's being said, but who is saying it and against who.** not just her, people almost never talk about abuse using gender neutral terms. they always say ""violence against women"" & ""abuse of women"" which prove that there is a culture of accepting violence and violent language against men not women.

66,"Wikipedia and other pages have been manipulated into removing articles on logical fallacies that harm the feminist narrative.

The most evident one I've been able to find is the article on Apex Fallacy. It is when people look at the highest positions of power (politics, CEOs, celebrity, etc) and see those positions are held by men. Then they falsely assume all men have that level of power when completely ignoring that it takes a lot of privilege and generational wealth to get those men into those places. Those positions aren't open to the common man.

Why is it ignored? Because it weakens their argument to acknowledge women who were born into the same privlidge always had the same doors opened to them. This helps secure funding for sexist scholarships, grants, and other government funded programs that ignore young men who never had those opportunities to begin with. It helps put underqualified women in positions of power and privilege they haven't earned.

Having the highest rates of suicide, mental illness, stress related diseases, death from violence, etc is not privlidge. It's a symptom of exactly the opposite",PussyPass,Wikipedia page manipulate remove article logical fallacy harm feminist narrative The evident one I able find article Apex Fallacy It people look high position power politics CEOs celebrity etc see position hold men Then falsely assume men level power completely ignore take lot privilege generational wealth get men place Those position open common man Why ignore Because weakens argument acknowledge woman bear privlidge always door open This help secure funding sexist scholarship grant government fund program ignore young men never opportunity begin It help put underqualified woman position power privilege earn Having high rate suicide mental illness stress related disease death violence etc privlidge It symptom exactly opposite
